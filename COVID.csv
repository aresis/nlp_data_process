"Like data from Australia, Thailand, etc? I feel like Thailand is under-reporting their numbers. I asked a friend in Bangkok about the situation there and she said its ""bad, hot, no tourism""."
During this covid-19 time spend time outdoors. Less chance for transmission as long as you are a lot more than 6 feet or 2 meters away from others. And so good for the souls and body !
"Whoever reads this try not to get alarmed when you see major spikes in the numbers of cases. That represents the number of tests that are being performed and reported. The reality is it can't be contained but it can be prevented. You just have to play the game of Dodge the Flu. What does that mean in your lifestyle? You have to define that. You may have to play this game for the next 1-2 years so get in and start as soon as possible. Really anyone who can work from home, should. Schools and all major gathering should stop.Everyone take a breath and get comfortable. We need supply chains to keep running and we need commerce to continue. There will be people who lose their jobs and businesses that will be forced to close. New jobs will open. More deliveries will have to happen. Sanitizing teams will be needed and more law enforcement will be needed. Look for work there. We have the greatest communication tool ever - the internet. We should already have the infrastructure in place to adjust to a no-covid lifestyle. Amazon, grocery stores etc. are all ready to deliver. Other business just have to adjust. Let's get the delivery people some suits and training and get to living a new life style. Unfortunately we have to reduce human to human interaction but that's what it will take. We can do it for the next couple of years or when a remedy  is found.If we keep commerce going and we adjust our lifestyles as a country we should be fine. This will be bigger than 9/11.  Let's keep our country strong and adjust to this threat. Expect more like this in the future if we allow it to cripple us too much as a country. This could be viewed as a biological attack and this country is under attack. Adjust your lifestyles, keep contributing to the economy in some way and let's get back to business. Let's keep our country great."
"Hi,So today at work someone came in talking about how they weren’t feeling well, we jokingly went over the symptoms of covid and she said she had a fever, cough and sore throat.I said she should go home because I didn’t wanna get sick. She stayed at work coughing a few times and wandering around the office, so, I sent a message to the manager asking him to send a message to everyone saying not to come in if they’re sick, he said something along the lines of wash your hands and don’t touch your face so you don’t get sick.About two hours later, I overheard her talking to other staff about covid so I said “can you please go get tested” then went on about why she should, I can’t get sick because I live with people who work with old people.About 30 minutes later I got a message from my boss saying I can’t direct coworkers about their health.Am I living in bizzaroworld or am I tripping out?I feel like I did the right thing and someone needed to say something. I’ll prolly get disciplined  for it.I’m not quite sure what to do, if she does get tested they definitely wont tell me now, and if she doesn’t and continues to come into work my roommates elderly patients could worst case die.I’m really summarizing so sorry if I didnt give a great explanation of what happened.What would you guys do?"
"I'm thinking we should bring this to the forefront of discussions. CEOs and other greedy executives are looking at their balance sheet and their pocketbooks right now. They will do what they can to maintain their ridiculous 9 - 10 figure salaries at the expense of people who might not even be able to afford, food/home/medication in this period.I would suggest anyone working for a major company announce their layoff and we keep a list of these companies' CEO's salary and the amount of people they laid off and make it public.Name and Shame them and their greed. We have an opportunity to show how these corporate GREED actually KILLS people now."
"Why is it so different from China or Germany for example? I'm basing these thoughts based on the John's Hopkins counter. I can imagine it has to do with an older population but then again so do Japan and Korea. What is making it so much deadlier in those countries and should we expect the same in other European countries like the UK, Netherlands, Germany?"
"I trust our experts are on this, but don't trust they would tell us right away if there was a critical shortage.   I would be less anxious if a spitball discussion of the numbers lined up with real-world capacity.How many people will require critical medical care and associated care-givers, personal protection equipment sets, beds, ventilators, etc. for a quickly widespread infection in the USA?  I've read articles discussing challenges with the statistics - under-reported infection, over-reported mortality.  Please suggest some simple math for imaginary worst-case estimates so we can move on to discussing how we could possibly address that need at-scale.   I'd be grateful for better numbers than below.  These look like we'll need stadium parking lots full of field hospitals.*  350M residents \* 10% infection rate at a peak point in time \* 10% requiring critical care with isolation = 3.5M beds, and the associated care-givers with PPE* \* 10% requiring ventilators = 350K ventilators Bonus points for any wild ideas on how to deliver at-scale!"
"Just talked to my younger brother, who I don’t talk enough. Said there is a small outbreak in Aspen. He has been sick last 1.5 weeks, fever and short of breath. Thinks he has CoronaVirus. Called doctor last week, no test avail, said to come in if symptoms get worse. He feels better now. #kickingcoronas_assHumanity will beat this, not politics."
"If your in a country that has effectively been locked down, once the panic buying had gone are the stores still stocked? Things like toilet roll and bread I assume are hard to get but other food stuffs are their still plenty of things to buy and eat? Seems the panic buying is just an uncertainty on the supply chain, have governments have to help food supply of have the private sector managed to keep things ticking along?  Also if your infected or self quarantined and have no support network how have you coped?"
Hi!I want some advice on a respirators because I am going to have to be in enclosed spaces with alot of people in the coming weeks. I have been thinking about buying a 3M 6500QL halfmask and 3M FFP3 2135 filters to protect myself. What do you think about this set up?Thanks in advance for your answers!
Trying to get data from news articles is brutal. Where is the day by day historical on total infections/by country? (and other data such as death rate)
"In the USA, finally found the balls to quit a job I hated. Huge amount of turnovers lately and was depressed for months. Three weeks after my two week's notice and a spring break vacation, the whole Italy COVID-19 fiasco happens.Just started a new job, but with no health insurance until May. I'm a young mid-20's guy who's pretty healthy. COBRA is expensive at $650/month. Is it worth it with the pandemic? What are my options here? Anyone have experience buying health insurance in the marketplace that is more reasonably priced for maybe 2-3 months?"
Just thinking that there is likely to be a glut of babies born in Dec / Jan next year after all this enforced self isolation for Covid-19. I’d just like to claim credit for coining the term “Coomers” for the presumed post Corona virus baby boom.
"I'm in Virginia. We're not locked down but I'm immunocompromised and trying to be safe. I've left my job (customer service....not the best place!) And am home. I do have a dog. When I can't ask my healthier roommate to walk her, I do it myself with a mask and desanitize immediately. What about clothes? Should I have something just for going outside in?"
"Let's say that we only need to get to 50% herd immunity to finish social distancing. And that only 2 out of 50 people who contract the virus need hospitalization (including those who have no symptoms and whose immune system quickly destroys the virus.)  And that the US has 50,000 dedicated icu beds for COVID patients (we don't have that many total). And that the hospitilization time is only a tad over 2 weeks so that a bed can have 25 patients a year. That means we could process 1.25 million COVID hospital patients a year and that 31.5 million people could get infected per year. If social distancing and such is able to give us exactly 50,000 patients every 2 weeks to perfectly flatten the curve...it will take over 5 years for half our population to have gone through COVID-19 and to achieve 50% immunity. Affordable anti-viral drugs, a lower hospitalization rate, or more icu beds would change this and a widespread vaccine would give us herd immunity in as fast as they could produce the shots. But life isn't going back to normal in a month or two."
"I am 9 weeks pregnant and scared.Not scared of what would happen if Corona keeps spreading, but rather of society. What am i going to do when ill need an echography?What am i going to do if theres a complication during the pregnancy but all the patients have Corona so i cant access a doctor? What am i going to do when ill have to give birth in october?What am i going to do if my child is born with it?How am i going to raise a child if there are no more schools open, produce in groceries, places open to buy diapers?I am terrified of the future. Especially knowing that my mother has been in contact with a couple who just came back from their trip in Thailand. I live in canada, in the province of Quebec. The first case of death by Covid-19 in Quebec was confirmed a couple of hours ago by my government. I. Am. Terrified."
"So lately I’ve been seeing people ( especially famous people ) saying : ‘stay the fuck inside.’You know because of the virus. And it makes me feel like shit. Like I’m a really bad person, because I have to go to work.No I’m not a nurse. I can do my work from home. But my boss doesn’t let me. Everybody there who has more experience than me can stay home every other day, so if one gets sick, the other can go to work. But no not me, I have to be there every day. My boss just stays home every day. And even tho I wanna stay home and work from there, i can’t. I hate it. I wanna help the world, but I can’t say : ‘ I won’t come in anymore.’ Because that can get me fired."
 We’ve been wiping things down at work with these wipes and I’m wondering if they will even do anything against this virus.
"So since we’re all quarantined for the few weeks I’ve came up with a list of stuff that can be cleaned around the house that maybe isn’t part of your usual cleaning routine. Feel free to add more!! I’m talking more than just “doing dishes and going through old clothes”1)Take down the curtains and wash them2)Roll big rugs and sweep under3)Scrub your dirty shoes! I’m a server and my work shoes were filthy4)Dust ceiling fans5)Take down and clean out the bathroom vent6)Sanitize yoga mat7)Wash your backpack! (The water was damn near black and my bag didnt even look dirty)8)Wipe the dust off indoor plants9)Vacuum the couch cushions10) Wash ALL bedding-pillows, bed skirt, all of it. 11) Deep clean makeup brushes and wash out the bag you keep your makeup in12) Wipe down the insides of the fridge- throw out all the old stuff while youre at it!13)Go through your pantry- check the expiration dates of things you know have been in there for a hot minute14) **DUST!** Window panels, high rise ceilings, whatever. My portable space heater had dust caked on the vent!15) Clean out that sock and underwear drawer- it’s time to let some of that go16) Deep clean the inside of your car! Sanitize the dashboard as well17) Wash your hairbrush- sounds dumb but actually lay your brush in a bowl of soap and water and hand scrub those those bristles! Use an old toothbrush if you have one.18) Remove lighting fixtures and get those dead bugs outComment if you have more suggestions! I got 2 weeks to get stuff done!"
Let me get to the point: I’m 18 years old and have dealt with emotional abuse for over half my life from my mom and dad and my older sister.  I can already see it coming up again and am not allowed to leave the house to spend time with people who don’t make me wanna kill myself cause I might possibly “get infected” when it comes down to it I’d rather risk infections then be stuck in this shit hole.
"If someone touches something that is contaminated with coronavirus, does everything they touch after that/people who touch it after others also get contaminated?"
"I live in Louisiana, USA. Our case numbers are steadily rising and there are rumors of a lockdown. Will I be able to continue on with my move? This could just be my anxiety talking, but I’m quite nervous about it. Any help or guidance is greatly appreciated."
"I saw the Gamestop and was curious.&amp;#x200B;If my work has directed us to come in to work, who do I contact in government to confirm we are actually considered essential services?Specifically CA, but would like to know other states as well, they'll be coming along shortly."
"Hey everyone - I just thought I'd make this basic beginners lesson for those who may have a guitar laying around gathering dust right now. I hope it helps, feel free to ask any questions. Peace and love ♥️https://youtu.be/KDv3MorpIlo"
"Okay so I get off work (hospital) and go to target on my way home to buy food and check for toilet paper for the billionth time. Guess what I see as I walk in. A shit ton of people just dawdling around in target browsing around the aisles like a it’s a normal Friday. Why can’t people stay home and only come for the essentials. This isn’t a vacation going to the store should be an in and out experience as to not risk others, yourself, and your family or the workers for a matter of fact! Shop online if you wanna browse it’s the perfect time for that!"
"I tried letting news outlets know about this incident but I have yet to get any response about this so I thought I would share this piece here with y'all. Here is a general idea of how the Ashley Home Furniture Distribution Center is taking their approach to the recent COVID-19 Outbreak. The distribution center, located by Canyon High School in New Braunfels, has over the past several months made crippling decisions to employees such as decreasing call center wages by several dollar amounts, decreased vacation time, increase the cost of insurance, etc. While these have shown the approach they take towards saving the company money, the true reveal of their morals came when COVID-19 became a pandemic and started limiting different businesses. While they have looked for ways to have call center employees work from home, the option was thrown out the window after software couldn't operate at home desktops and instead have them continue to work in a cramped work center. Some businesses continue to operate during this time, however the next part really makes no sense and is very ANTI-employee. If said worker was to contract COVID-19, they are being punished for staying home and will be hit with a strike towards attendance. Eventually enough strikes lead to termination. So while we are informed to stay home if we're sick, the distribution center wishes to punish you for being sick and risk your job. So do you still attend work and risk spreading if by some bad luck you have COVID? Or do you stay home and risk losing your job? Thats the decision they are forcing them to make. On top of this, they have forced every employee to sign an acknowledgement that keeps them from talking about COVID-19 and how the company approaches it. Many people in the call center are sick now (Unconfirmed if they are COVID positive or not) and employees are scared to come in. Management is putting their employees at high risk of exposure to the virus and keeping them quiet about it. Gamestop may be getting shit for staying open here, but these people are going to be 100% exposed if nothing is done about this soon."
"How effective would a bucket of water with a pool chlorine tab in it be for disinfecting hands (rinsing with fresh afterwards of course). If is a good idea:1. How long should you swish your hands in there?2. How long do you think a family of 4 could reuse the same bucket for disinfecting without having to replace the tab/water?If it’s a horrible idea, please tell."
"Hi, I have a mandatory 14 days quarantine because I came from overseas, plus we will have mandatory curfew for 19 days. My question is... What is the reason of the 14 days... What happens after those days if you have Covid?  And I you didn't, what does it mean for you?"
Italy and Germany for example have very similar median ages of their populations (45.5 for Italy and 47.1 for Germany) but Italy has a 9% mortality rate and Germany's is .3%.I'm here in America seeing the 1% mortality rate and trying to decide if that's a reassuring thing or if countries are reporting deaths differently.Median ages came from Wikipedia and mortality rates were figured out using Worldmeters.
I have lost all respect for my friends who not only went bars last weekend but are now hanging out in large groups since the the bars are closed. So incredibly selfish. I want to cut some friends off and not associate with them. I have tried to talk about it with them and they just ignored me. There is 0 excuse to be ignorant at this point. Am I being dramatic? Is anyone else going through similar emotions or situations?
"We went into a grocery in the afternoon on Saturday.He grabs a shopping trolley, does not wipe the handle  down with an amazingly  available sanitary wipe, much to my dismay.We proceed to the nearby deli counter where he then rubs his eye and then orders food which he plans on eating whilst shopping.We're in the store for less than 2 minutes at this point and in my mind it's already a nightmare infection situation.I plead with him, saying that I wished he cared more, hoping he doesn't eat those snacks without washing his hands first.  He pushes the likely contaminated trolly away from the deli counter and before I can get another word out while digging into the bag with his dirty hand pulling out a snack and putting it into his mouth as I sigh a defeated sigh.  He has the nerve to offer me one of those snacks at this point.  Later in our shopping trip one of his snacks has a hair in it... I refrain from laughing while pointing out the closest garbage bin for him to toss it into.I know this story may not be the best written at this point but you all get the gist.On a normal day I am not fond of germs, today, my hands are so dry from so much more washing than usual.  I'm in near panic mode now.   I'm doing the best I can to protect myself but my efforts are being sabotaged.Back in the day he was not scared of H1N1/flu, and then he got it.... And he was miserable.  He's gotten a flu shot every year since then... He's now not scared of COVID-19.... He's acting so careless he's likely to get it and to be honest it will be hard for me to feel sorry for him if he does get it.I am so angry at him for being so careless.  I just don't even know what to do at this point. I can't talk to anyone about this as he does not care and my mum is worried about me dying from this even though I am not even 40 yet.  I am also scared about talking about this with others I know because I'm afraid they will think I'll infect them because of his carelessness.  He thinks I'm a germ Nazi when he has a cold... Just imagine if he gets Covid!  I just want to sleep in the caravan so I can better protect myself."
"Every time you hoard groceries, you’re making it so other people don’t get them- including the old, sick, and disabled- people who actually have reason to be scared. So forgive your checkout person if they don’t have much sympathy for you when you pull up to checkout with 200 items, complaining about things being out of stock."
"There is almost no information about disinfection procedures for reusing thermometers other than using disposable plastic covers. Common household thermometers (thermister-type) can be completely submerged is isopropanol solution for disinfection - it is safe for electronics, commonly used for water-damaged cell phones, etc. These thermometers are in extremely short supply right now, hence the need for reuse.The basis of disinfection is that the EPA time to kill for 70-91% isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol, aka ""rubbing alcohol"", 91% dries faster) is estimated to be a few minutes for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2). We use 30 minutes out of an abundance of caution.* NOTE: Beware of every step of contamination. The thermometer is contaminated. If you touch it with your hands, your hands are contaminated. If you touch it with gloves, those gloves are contaminated. If you then touch something else, that thing is contaminated.* Take the batteries out of your thermometer.* Place the thermometer and battery cover unattached inside a plastic ziplock bag. Place the batteries inside a different ziplock bag. (Placing batteries in separate bag avoids hypothetical corrosion of electronics from electrolysis)* Close the ziplock bags. Wash your hands. Wash the *outside* of the ziplock bags and any external surfaces you touched to remove external contamination.* Now open the ziplock bags. Pour the 70–91+% isopropanol inside the ziplock bags, just enough to completely submerge the items. Isopropanol is not corrosive to electronics that are turned off, that is why you removed the batteries.* Shake the bags periodically to completely cover every part of the thermometer, electronics, etc. Keep them submerged and periodically shaken for at least 10 minutes. The battery should be removed after 10 minutes because it is slowly discharging, the other parts can be submerged for longer, perhaps 30 minutes.* If you were careful, your hands, the outside of the bags, the inside of the bags, and the thermometer and all its parts are sterile.* Remove the parts, shake them off, dispose of the alcohol in the sink - it is biodegradable, and also highly flammable. Let parts dry in a sterile environment for 24–48 hours depending on your location’s humidity and temperature, or use a hair blow dryer for one hour at 1ft distance.* Reassemble the dry thermometer avoiding contamination. Do not insert batteries until the thermometer is completely dry inside.Edit: If this is too complicated, you can simply wait 10 days. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, cannot survive longer than a week on plastic and metal surfaces. Alternatively or additionally, you can bake everything except the battery at 160F-180F for 30 minutes, which will kill the fragile virus (a procedure used on N95 masks). The battery cannot be baked, and will have to be sterilized separately like in the procedure."
26[m] I was just recently in NOLA and Las vegas [about a week and a half ago] . This past weekend I started feeling a shortness of breath when I would lay down to nap and when I was walking . I had a minor cough last night and felt a tingle in my throat but I woke up this morning feeling fine. Only thing I still have is the shortness of breath. My brother who is a nurse is telling me in should go to the e.r if I still feel like this throughout the day but I don't want to spend the money and feel like I should be okay as long as I self quarantine and stay hydrated. Any thoughts?
"Has the president given up on helping people through this crisis and is now just calculating ""acceptable losses""?  Its true that the economy and people will suffer financial upheaval, but I wonder how scared the billionaires are right now? Are they worried that they could end up like the rest of us? Are we confident that the choices being made are in our best interest, and not just in the best interest of the uber rich?""Aides say Trump is itching for the guidelines to be eased at the end of the 15-day period, but realistically there are few health experts who think that's enough time to know whether the measures he announced last week will suffice. Trump and some of his top officials are growing more anxious with social distancing guidelines put in place to combat the coronavirus, sources close to the White House effort said. One senior official said the  President is losing patience with the period of national self-isolation  that has frozen the US economy.""[https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/politics/trump-coronavirus-15-days-social-distancing/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/23/politics/trump-coronavirus-15-days-social-distancing/index.html)Trump claimed that the Food and Drug  Administration ""had approved the ""very powerful"" drug chloroquine to  treat the virus"". Shortly after the FDA released a statement that said this was not true and they had not even done clinical trials. But because Trump said this (from a position of power) people around the world took it seriously. In Nigeria, the price for that drug rose by 400%. Gee, nice profit for anyone invested in that drug...even if it is proven to not work next week...those investors will clean up in the meantime.  Even more sad are the reports of chloroquine poisoning because people believed that statement.

"While out getting a few things today one thing that I was doing was asking when the keypad for debit cards was last cleaned. If not recently, I would request that they do so now. 7/7 times they had nothing there to do so.I then would pull a pen from my pocket for pushing the buttons, and tell them to tell their manager that this is something that really should be done. And don't use their pen to sign slips...use your own because you just don't know.Same goes for ATM's, gas pumps, elevator buttons and anything with a keypad that is used 1,000,000 times a day.Am I paranoid? Yup. Do I care that people think I paranoid? Nope. Do I want to stay as healthy as I can, as a  high-risk person, during the Pandemic? YUP!Please feel free to share with your friends.  Thanks for reading.  Stay safe and healthy."
"Out of fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath, etc -- Do they usually come in a certain order? I have a dry sore throat all day today but nothing else, and I'm not sure if I'm being paranoid or not."
If someone is interested in learning more about this virus and how it works instead of spreading false information then I have attached a study on the virus. Stay educated and stay safe.
"I volunteer at a non-profit animal rescue and wanted to bring to light the double edged sword that is hitting them extra hard right now.Animal rescues rely heavily on donations and volunteers, but also source a great deal of their income through adoption fees and fundraisers. All of that is shut down right now. Animals are still coming in, food costs are piling up, more work is being put on paid employees when volunteers are unable to work, and no adoption appointments mean no animals are leaving and no adoption income is coming in. Things are challenging on a good day, these are hard days.Everyone is suffering, but if you have anything you can spare they would greatly appreciate it!"
"I’m a primary care physician, and I’ve been exposed three different times over the past week to covid, only to find out today after the latest that I might have been exposed to it. A patient who said they hadn’t been exposed to a covid positive person. With further questioning they mentioned that a few of the residents in the retirement home they work at are being tested but results haven’t come back. I was properly precautioned against the first two but not this one. We have such limited kits, less than 5 per office that we have to screen those who are high risk in order to save supplies and test those who are high risk. Please inform your healthcare workers if there is anyone that’s being tested that you’ve been exposed to, even if the test hasn’t come back yet. Now I wait, I’m working from home for the next two weeks, wash your hands with soap and have individual bathrooms for any suspected."
"I was a child when the Vietnam War was being waged. I remember listening to the noon news on the radio.""Today, 14 US soldiers were killed and 27 were wounded.  40 Viet Cong were killed.""This was on  the news every day.  The numbers always changed, but there were always numbers.Now, again because of a pig-headed President, we are hearing numbers every day.*For Whom The Bell Tolls; It Tolls For Thee.*William Shakespeare, Macbeth"
"So, I live in Brazil.And my president has just managed to effectively make me envy having Trump as a president and leader at a time like this.No, really.Bolsonaro has just claimed for everyone to end the isolation, and that it is just a flu and won't affect anyone. During a presidential address on national television.  I did not think it was possible to have a worse response than Trump, but Thor damnit, he is trying!"
"Hi all.  In light of the current public health situation, the funeral  home in my rural hometown is starting to live stream funeral services via YouTube for those who cannot attend, and they have put out a request. In order to stream from mobile, which will be necessary for graveside-only services, they must meet the threshold of 1000 subscribers. If it feels comfortable and appropriate, you can subscribe [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNEs1dELujzofzmrPZ0dtRw).  No need to get notifications or otherwise engage in any way (not that the algorithm is going to push it), just a courtesy sub if it feels  okay to give it. No monetary gain or clout to be had, just helping offer a much-needed service to loved ones mourning in these uncertain times. Thanks."
"(X-posted to advice)(Originally posted in r/relationships)We have been together for a bit more than a year.Where I live isn't in official, legally enforced lockdown yet, but I suspect it soon will be. Currently we are all being told to ""stay home and practise social distancing"" in an effort to curb the spread, but the numbers of infected people are rising daily.My boyfriend and I do not live together. In fact, we both live with our respective families. My parents are  in their fifties and sixties and have hypertension, which puts them at high risk. My boyfriend's mother smokes, and he himself is asthmatic, which I'm pretty sure makes both of them high risk.I am not happy that I probably won't be able to see my boyfriend in person for months, especially as the last time I saw him I had no idea that we would soon be in this situation where everyone is being asked to stay at home to prevent the spread. The situation with Covid 19 got very fucking real very suddenly. We had no preparation, no warning that suddenly we would just be separated for the better part of a year.And obviously this sucks, but what's worse is that he DOES NOT UNDERSTAND that this social distancing stuff applies to him and I. He isn't actively fighting me on it anymore, but he seems to think that I could just come over whenever I want if I really wanted to. It's like he thinks I'm just being anxious and paranoid and stubborn. I've tried sending him links to articles explaining the seriousness of the illness. I've tried telling him that even if in general young people can handle it better, there are plenty of young, perfectly healthy people who have had serious cases and even died from it. He waves it off as doom and gloom and me focusing on the worst possibilities - and it's true, I can be over anxious about stuff. But I'm pretty sure this isn't the case this time.He's not totally flippant. He understands the concept of ""flattening the curb"" and I believe he is taking relevant precautions when running necessary errands. He isn't meeting in person with friends and from what I understand he is only taking occasional, necessary trips to the grocery store when he leaves his house. He was laid off from his job just as shit was starting to get real here, because the industry he works in was very hard hit and basically ordered to shut down entirely.So it's not like he doesn't get it at all, but as far as he's concerned, if I'm not socially distancing from my parents (whom I live with), there's no reason I have to socially distance myself from him. I really think he believes that I can just consider him a ""house member accessory"" or something, but I can't. We don't live together. We both individually still have to interact, minimally, with the public by going grocery shopping (though I do have n95 masks that I got for work ages ago, which I have been using). It sounds like his mother is still visiting friends and family, which is not something that is my place to protest, but it adds to the fact that my household and his household are not and could never be considered a ""closed unit"".If I unknowingly pass the disease to him or his family, or take it from his household and pass it on to my own, and they have a serious case or die, I could never forgive myself. I have actually broken down crying on the phone explaining my concern to him, and I believe that is why he has stopped fighting me about it, but it doesn't mean he really understands.Just today he asked me when I will come see him again, and I told him it might be awhile. He said ""come onnnnn"". I dread the likelihood that we will get into a fight about it again. It's hard enough coming to terms with the reality that I'm not going to see him in person for almost a year, possibly, or several months at the least - and face the hopefully unnecessary worry that because his mother isn't being very cautious, he could well die anyway and I'd never see him again at all - without him being on the same page as me.So if you have any advice on how to get through to him, and really get him to understand that this is serious, longterm, and not just me acting out an anxious whim... please give it to me.TL;DR: How do I get my boyfriend to understand that I won't be able to see him for quite awhile due to lockdown and social distancing because of Covid 19, and that I can't just ""make an exception"" for him because that isn't how social distancing WORKS?"
"Where are all the Covid survivors? I’ve been looking around online for places where they exist to share their experiences, but can’t seem to find any such groups. Anyone in this group test positive for the virus? What were your symptoms?"
"Do y’all think this has been here longer than the current wave of it? This is my reasoning of question. About a month and a half or so ago my daughter and I were in a nearby city shopping at the mall. We had a great day and she was totally fine all day. When we got home, she took a nap. When she woke up, she woke up really sick. She sweats in her sleep but I could feel the heat fuming off of her like fire. The nurse line for her doctor called an ambulance because of her breathing. Her lungs were clear, but she had a cough, a fever, and odd breathing and it came on VERY rapidly. She tested negative for Flu and RSV and they sent her home with an unsure diagnosis and said it was probably upper respiratory or a bad cold. I know some have said it hasn’t been as aggressive in children. I’m curious if she had this since she didn’t test positive for anything"
"My son has his learners permit so we still go out driving as a way to get out of the house while respecting social distancing.  We noticed that while the majority of business are closed, closing early, or have no customers - hotels seem to be quite busy.  We live in the Midwest.  It seems like travel is down, so it seems weird that hotels have so many cars in their parking lots."

"I have a brother in my house who was diagnosed as presumptive positive with coronavirus and had the pretty traditional dry cough, fever, sore throat symptoms for one week before we took him to a walk-in clinic and the doctor sent us all home to quarantine. They refused to test him (even though his boss had just returned from Italy) because he wasn't at large risk of fatality. He still isn't much better.Now my mom and, another week later, have felt terrible the last few days but with these really odd and hard to describe symptoms ... we call it ""Pac-Man eating the heart"" because it feels like a little gnaw constantly. Fast-beating heart rate &amp; trouble breathing deeply, especially if we don't just sit on the couch and do nothing all day.

I'm planning on staying home and listening to all the appropriate authorities on the matter, but I had a question.The way I understand it (and I could be wrong) regular exposure to bacteria and whatnot from other people helps keep our immune systems strong.  Is there risk after the stay at home orders are lifted that we'll be more susceptible to flu-like diseases due to the isolation?Please know I'm not asking this as a way to encourage people to go out and do stupid stuff, it's just genuine curiosity.-Thanks"
"Hello everyone, I’m currently on day 14 since my perceived exposure. After contacting my doctor, due to lack of supplies I have not been able to get a test done to confirm. However, I figured I’d document my symptoms and the timeline of their progression for you.

Saturday 3/14Trip to Grocery store Day of suspected initial exposureSunday - no symptoms Monday - no symptomsTuesday - tiredness/fatigue/some sneezingWednesday - no symptoms during daytime, strong night sweats and fever when sleepingThursday - same as Wednesday, light cough startingFriday - “anxiety” type feeling of chest tightness, cough worsens, very tiredSaturday - chest is tighter, difficult to breathe, throat tickle and cough worseningSunday - very difficult to breathe, cannot take full breath in, chest cramps, strong dry cough, feels like congestion right above tracheaMonday - lightheaded from getting out of bed and moving around, stairs = seeing stars, coughing fits start giving me pinhole vision each time, extreme chills/trembles for short period at night Tuesday - chest tightness improves slightly, cough still persistent, another episode of chills for 10 minutes at nightWednesday - woke up essentially paralyzed - entire back muscles on both sides completely strained to the point of only being able to breathe in about 35% lung capacity before clenching up from pain. Hot shower helped a LOT but pain remained as soon as I got out, spent the entire day laying on a hardwood floor breathing very shallowly. Other symptoms: chest tightness improves more, cough lessens but is still persistent, began coughing up phlegm instead of dry coughThursday - feeling much better, first day I can take a deep breath of air once again, cough and upper chest congestion still very persistent, fatigue still apparent, sore throat beginning to appear, entire back is now sore and aching from Wednesday’s episode, breathing difficulty, chest congestion and nasal inflammation all appear to get worse in the eveningsFriday - woke up feeling much better than any other day. Cough seemed to be going away. Lungs felt fine. ~3pm chest cramps begin, upper chest congestion returns and cough returns. ~6pm difficulty breathing again for ~3 hours, sore throat worse and cough worseningEdit:Saturday 3/28: woke up with trouble breathing again, cough is mild.

"Hey everyone, I’m a microbiologist at Duke university. I mostly research new disinfectants in clinical environments. Given that, I’ve always assumed folks usually read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the product labels. I have never been more wrong. After discussing with my friends and family, small sample size I know, I’ve realized this is not the norm and right now it really needs to be. I’ve recently started to blog to improve my writing and discuss my work which I think is highly relevant at the moment. Now that the overwhelming majority of folks are home, and those deemed essential and are still going out daily, it’s imperative you’re actually ridding your house of COVID-19.

"The results showed that the infection rate of close contacts of confirmed patients was 6.3% and that of asymptomatic infection was 4.11%. The researchers believe that there is no statistically significant difference in infection rates.An article  entitled ""The epidemiological characteristics of infection in close contacts of COVID-19 in Ningbo city"" published by Chen Yi et al. , in the Chinese Journal of Epidemiology, vol. 41, 2020. **Abstract****Objective**To estimate the infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and to evaluate the risk of COVID-19 under different exposure conditions.**Methods**A prospective study was used to conduct continuous quarantine medical observations of close contacts of people infected with COVID-19, collect epidemiological, clinical manifestations, and laboratory test data to estimate the infection rate of close contacts under different exposures.**Results**The epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Ningbo showed persistent human-to-human characteristics. A total of 2 147 close contacts were tracked and investigated. The total infection rate was 6.15%. The infection rates of confirmed cases and positive contacts were 6.30% and 4.11%, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (*P*\&gt;0.05). Among close contacts of different relationships, friends/pilgrims (22.31%), family members (18.01%), and relatives (4.73%) have a higher infection rate, and close contacts of medical staff were not infected. Differences in infection rates among the close contacts were statistically significant (*P*&lt;0.005). Living with the case (13.26%), taking the same transportation (11.91%), and dining together (7.18%) are high risk factors for infection. Cross-infection in the hospital should not be ignored (1.94%). The median of incubation period is 5 days.**Conclusion**The infection rate of close contacts of COVID-19 cases is high, and isolation medical observation measures should be implemented in strict accordance with the close contact management plan.

Unemployment is saying that she needs to search for a job and we dont think that she can file for the unemployment insurance since our unemployment isnt directly involved with covid. We want to work but jobs are not available. Does anyone have any advice as to how we could turn this around? Im willing to do just about anything but I have limited resources.

Ok, it takes a while for symptoms to show - are they saying then that all of those deaths that could happen are for people that have already caught it? I just want this all to end 😭"
"It's  been sent 1 hour ago on Twitter by Didier Raoult. He released his  latest covid-19 treatment evidences on real people.

What the latest  1003 stat shows without doubt is that giving that chloroquine protocol  as early as covid tested and assuming we have this strategy in place and  we don't wait for the covid-19 to evolve into pneumonia/lung  infection/death, then it's confirmed that it reduces mortality rate, and quite sensibly."
"So, as everyone can see, POTUS is full of bad information regarding the virus.  When queried, he ALWAYS gives the public bad information or acts like a child and starts blaming various entities for this or that.  My question here is: why can’t we simply ignore him and only reference people that actually know what they are talking about?  Can’t we just skip asking him anything and go to the experts? In any other line of work, he would have been asked to leave the talking to those who understand the situation and have useful input.  Also, if Twitter is now filtering remarks from other ignorant people like Giuliani, can’t they cut Trump of now too?  Doing so will save lives."

My grandparents who both live in a retirement home have tested positive for covid 4 days ago. They live in a retirement home with around 100 to 150 people in a small town (maybe 3000 to 5000 people). They're in their mid 90s and the nurses/doctors don't have much confidence in them making it through. Has anyone experienced first hand someone who's had this virus? Old or young?I've only heard things through the news and online. It's a scary situation because if they have it I'm sure many others do including nurses and doctors who work there then go back to their families and possibly spread it to them too.
"I will tell you about Covid-19 in Russia. And a little to myself. Last week in Moscow, and then throughout the country, they introduced a self-isolation regime. No one calls a quarantine a quarantine. There is a word for self-isolation.Almost all jobs were closed. Only food stores and pharmacies are available It is forbidden to move around the city. Almost like in China.People are sitting without a salary.And if Moscow introduced a benefit in the amount of 19500 rubles. ( 230 dollars) then in other regions - silence People are offered to stay at home, not work. And not to eat. Because there is no money.What to do is unclear. How to live on too The saddest thing is that I had heart surgery before that. Broken arm. That is, there are no savings at all. Now I have to survive without money. How to do this is unclear I understand that there is a pandemic in the world. But shouldn't the state take care of its citizens?"

" Qatar “labor camps” are being locked down by authorities and workers with coronavirus concentrated inside them are in conditions that deny them basic human rights. According to a report at the Guardian, hundreds of construction workers now have the virus amid the global pandemic and Qatar’s policies of concentrating the people  together in “squalid,over-crowded camps” enables the virus to “spread  rapidly.”  The workers are some of the thousands slaving away on the FIFA World Cup infrastructure projects. “Inside the quarantined  camps, workers  describe an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty,” the report notes. Workers are being put  on unpaid leave and it is getting worse by the day. Labor camps where the coronavirus sufferers are concentrated are given numbers within Qatar’s expansive gulag of workers camps. “Workers from camp 1 to camp 32 are in lockdown,” one man from Bangladesh said to the *Guardian*."

"Hii. I (F32) think I got Covid-19 last week, as I have pretty much all the symptoms. Fever, dry cough, sore throat, choking sensation, pressure in my chest, on/off loss of smell, extreme fatigue etc. I just feel terrible in all honesty, and I do not feel like I have a cold or the flu (have also had flu vaccine). First few days were not too bad, but now I just feel so fatigued. I had a hot drink earlier and was exhausted from making/drinking it.  I'm in the UK, and obviously they are not dealing with this very well. Keep reading/hearing about how hospitals are running out of equipment and so on, and that they soon will need to prioritise giving treatment to those who are more likely to survive, and leave the sicker ones to die alone basically. I'm anxious that I'll end up needing hospital treatment or something at some point. On the good side, I did not have a fever yesterday, and only a mild choking sensation (the other day was horrible).  Called the non-emergency hotline 111 and they said to take paracetamol and have soup.   Just ranting. How can I try to speed up recovery? I try to rest, but I am on my own with a 6 year old, so I need to make sure he's okay too. Thankfully he's not sick. Have no support system around me, so it's just me pretty much."

"Hi. I am having problems with my essential workplace insisting on people wiping down their areas. I work for a semi truck shop in a smaller town. My boss thinks the virus isn't a big deal. He had close contact with a person and didn't seem to get the virus or show symptoms. There's only been 5 cases in our whole county as of yet. Most people think it's overblown out here. Our corporate office is in a city so theyre taking it extremely serious. We are supposed to wipe down our tool boxes constantly. I walked around the shop today and noticed that some of the tool boxes haven't been washed off in months. I brought it to his attention and he laughed at me and said he's not going to monitor it. He said if I was too scared to come to work I should stay home. We got into a heated discussion and he threatened to write me up when I said he wasnt smarter than everyone..not my smartest move😬 anyways, I feel like I'm going crazy and maybe I'm listening to the wrong people. I'm not crazy right??? I feel like he should be protecting us. We are a shop and we deal with semis that go in and out of big cities everyday...i looked at the OSHA guidelines and it says we should be washing everything down regularly...is there anyone to talk to on this? Am I blowing it out of proportion? I don't want to cause anymore waves as I live in a small town and I don't want to lose my job. Especially in times like this....any advice would help"

Legit threatened me and while you told my district manager that you said things you shouldn't have in the moment you didn't hear my apology you flipped.

I put myself and my very young son, we both have respiratory illnesses, at risk every day by showing up to work. I damage my lungs further with the fumes from the bleach I'm using to try and keep you and I safe. Fuck clapping at your window or your balcony to show your gratitude for those of us still working.

"Almost every time I have to stop at a gas station to fill up (I am considered essential) and I go inside to get a drink/snack, there is almost always someone at the counter buying lottery tickets and nothing else.

When they pay for their tickets and they have a couple bucks change, ""Oh let me get a #6 and a #13 as well."" The lottery is not fucking important right now and you assholes are helping make sure this shit stays around longer than it needs to be. You might not be sick but you sure as fuck can spread it to others. How does it feel knowing that you potentially killed people just so you could lose at the lottery? Stay the fuck at home dickbags!"
"My background- So the Sunday before last my journey began with a red sore throat along with nausea and diarrhea off and on... by Wednesday, it looked and felt infected and I began having a bit of tightness in my chest. I called my immunologist (I have specific antibody deficiency disorder) and they swabbed me for covid. Extreme Nausea persisted along with the sore throat,  I could eat some times and sometimes I couldn’t. Friday I started to wheeze and freaked out. I called them back and they asked to see me. I went in and she said my throat looked infected but couldn’t hear anything within my lungs. Either way she gives me a strong antibiotic for strep and it covered lower and upper respiratory as well. I requested a CT. My symptoms persisted and worsened. 2/3 days later I’m really struggling to breath and I’m taking a breathing treatment every 4 hours. My Pulmonologist was sent my ct ant my request and he called me to tell me that I have pneumonia, top and bottom of my right lung. He said he’s overseeing the critical care covid patients at the hospital as ordered (I believe he’s military if I’m not mistaken). He told me the following : “look, I’m sorry you have pneumonia during a pandemic. I’d normally biopsy your lung to find out why that strong antibiotic isn’t working and to find out what would work best. No doctor is doing that right now as there’s a pandemic underway  (duh) and I’d be risking my life as well as my staffs lives.” Understandable. So I asked “what do I do”. Stay in bed, elevate, rest, go buy a oximeter and robitussin DM. If you feel as you truly are going to die come to the ER. If not, don’t come. There’s no breathing treatments here for fear of cross contamination. You’d only be able to use an inhaler and if you’re bad enough, we would give you a breathing machine. Besides I believe you have the weak covid, if you had the stronger one, you’d have pneumonia through that whole lung around day 5 (what- 2 strains?) yes- stay out of here if you can, there’s a worse strain than what you have- in promise- Fight it the best you can and isolate” I thought I was dead. But here I am, 13 days later feeling a lot better miraculously. I thought I would NEVER get to this day. Just last night I was still struggling to breathe all night . That mucinex dm was a game changer (I opted for this instead of the robitussin because it was stronger).————-/——/———————————————Down to my question- last 5-7 days (children 4/10) have a horrible hacking cough as they sleep especially. Last 3 days- girlfriend also has a horrible hacking cough but only as she sleepsI told her and the boys about it and no one said they woke up. They sleep right through it. My girlfriend actually basically told me I was lying. This is a weird trait I’ve never seen in my kids and especially an adult. How can a violent cough not be something to wake you? Anyone else with covid experience this? Wondering if we should continue to isolate or go get tested. It’s day 13 for my by the way. I’m praying in reaching the finish line AND I STILL HAVE NOT GOT RESULTS FROM Quest. Funny because all the negatives around here from quest come back in 4 days. I talked to my local urgent care and they said longest test they’d seen was a week and a day. I’ve been waiting 10 days!Thanks in advance b"
"Anyone had coronavirus already? Two nights ago I came down with a very sudden high fever (39.5 C), shivers and a severe headache. Yesterday I rested all day with around 38.5 fever and by evening my fever was 37.5. Today my fever is gone but I still feel weak and shaky. I was refused a test as I am not in a risk group, but the doctor who spoke to me on the phone says it sounds like corona. Considering how fast my fever disappeared, I'm not so sure. Did anyone else just have a random sudden one day of hell with corona? Am I out of the woods?"

"I live in Argentina and have been isolated since march 12. I love being home. But there's only so much you can do... And as someone with diagnosed depression, having a lot of free time is... well, dangerous. I can't stop my mind from making up all these scenarios where I'm out of a job where this is over, and then I'll have to do something i don't like, and then my dreams will be over. Yes, it's that dramatic. Logically, I'm aware it's not realistic. This is a global pandemic and an exceptional situation for everyone, not just me. I'm well aware I shouldn't be worrying, just focusing on staying safe. But my brain just hates me.Another thing is that any thought that comes up in my head is impossible to let go of. And then comes another one. And another. And another. You get it.Anyone else feeling like me?"
"So I found out I am expecting. I am also a college student. I am also a manager at an ""essential"" fast food business. My job has me pushing full time frontline with no help since most of the minors are out of work or are quitting due to the virus. I am fucked. So fucked. Btw it is midterm month pretty much for college students."
"I live near Boston with two roommates. We all have our own bedrooms and share a living room, bathroom, and kitchen. One of my roommates has left and I have no idea where he is, so that's one thing. But my other roommate has taken to alleviating his boredom by bringing his gf over every single weekend. He's also invited one or two other people briefly. Personally, I have social anxiety so I generally disapprove of this sort of thing anyways. But given COVID, I really don't feel like there should be people over this much, if at all. If it was up to me, there would be a no guests, period, policy. At the same time, I don't have a significant other, nor do I bring people over anyways, and so I don't have any such thing to consider in my case. I know it must be difficult for my roommate, who is much more outgoing than I. Generally, I also try to pick my battles careful when it comes to roommates. I find that to be best to avoid tension. What do you guys think? Should I try and ask my roommate to stop, or do you think that it's not too unreasonable of him? And how would you recommend going about it, either way?"
dispose of those gloves in a garbage or a bag then throw it out. There's plastic used gloves all over the parking lot in front of grocery stores. There's better ways to throw these gloves out.
"Are the same antibodies being produced from the various different strains of COVID-19 virus? Or are the antibodies different?If the antibodies are indeed the same, would it be safe to declare the individuals who have these antibodies as ""immuned"" and ready to go back to work?And if they are indeed immuned from reinfection, are they infectious? Could they still spread the virus to others?If it is indeed true that i) the antibodies are the same across the different strains of COVID-19, ii) individuals with antibodies are immuned to re-infection, iii) these individuals does not spread the virus, then we need more, more, more antibodies testing! It's probably more economical to spend millions and billions on healing people/identifying these ""fit for work"" people so that they can go back to work, than to spend billions and trillions trying to delay the economy from entering into a deep depression by giving free money away to businesses and individuals for not working."
"Well I have a few elderly neighbours that can't go out during this time. Most are in the most vunrable category, so daily I go round and ask do they need anything at from Iceland or Morrison's. I know I am putting myself at risk, I'm a young man (33) I know If I caught this flu my body would be able to fight it better than most of the people I am trying to help, I do cover up wear gloves and a mask. It's been the 2 metre rule for 2 weeks now but when I do go shopping I have noticed people not respecting other people space. Most shops have tape down with the space people are meant to abide by. I might be looking at items on shelves an people are barging by sometimes banging into me. People have no respect in times like this. And if you can please check up on elderly neighbours, you can give them a helping hand or even go talking to them for an hour so they don't get lonely. Sorry about the long post. And abit of a rant"
"I tested positive for COVID mid-March and was counted as one of the recovered as of last week, but still experiencing symptoms and some of them are just... weird. I’m looking for info online but really it’s hard to find because there’s so much on how to know if you have it or avoid it, not what it’s like, what recovery is like, etcI wouldn’t call my case mild, but it wasn’t so dire I needed to go into emergency. I had the described symptoms we all hear about: high fever, shortness of breath, dry unproductive cough, and this terrible feeling like my sinuses and then my lungs were just doused in pool water. Sore throat at the very beginning. Nose was never runny, just hurt. About 5 days in I was worrying about my will and whether I was going to die, because it felt like I had a vice on my rib cage, every breath hurt, and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest. It lasted 14 days, almost exactly. And I didn’t feel like I was improving until the last few.I also had significant gi symptoms they’re starting to report about. I lost at least 20 pounds but my scale stopped working so I can’t track anymore. I couldn’t eat much, and when I did I felt ill, then within 24 hours I had terrible diarrhea.I’ve had multiple rounds of fever break then return while I was down with it. I’d feel like maybe I was getting better, then get worse. Like a rollercoaster. Then I had 3 days without fever, and along with meeting 2 other criteria I was released from isolation (not that I was going anywhere). Recovery is similar. Up and down. Better then worse.Though the fever, cough, shortness of breath are gone, I’m still easily winded, still get very tired, and still have gi symptoms. I can eat maybe one meal a day. Tonight, I had pieces of something slough off the upper part of my throat or back of my sinuses. Big pieces. I was able to cough some of it up but the results were f*ing horrifying. The size of my finger. I’m still reeling because it was such an alien experience and I half expected the things that came out of my throat to sprout legs and start walking around. What is recovery like for you? Hard? Easy? Are you going nuts like I am wondering if what you’re experiencing is normal? I’m hoping we can help each other.*Edits for grammar/clarity, details on what recovery has been like for me.*"
"Essential isn’t front line.On the topic of Covid-19.  I think it’s very important to remember that an essential worker is nowhere near the same thing as a frontline worker. I’m an essential worker. I’m part of team of tradesmen maintaining and fixing equipment in a hospital.  Covid-19 is around me, but for the majority of my day I can easily avoid those areas entirely.My wife however is a frontline worker (nurses, doctors, respiratory therapists, cleaners, etc).  She’s not keeping equipment working. She’s keeping people alive. Shes not down the hallway from positive patients, she’s in the room with positive patients. Working directly on them,In contact with them,Cleaners clean everything they’ve touched.There is a big difference in the “sacrifices” we are making. I’m no hero. I’m just doing my job carefully and washing my hands a lot. She is."
Hello! Me and my boyfriend are younger and have both quarantined for 2 weeks. Is it safe to visit him? Or is that wrong? Everyone in my household and his household have also been quarantined. Thanks!
"On the topic of Covid-19, Earlier today my mom brought something up which got me thinking, about two months ago I was experiencing flu like symptoms, I had body aches, I was coughing, I had a fever, and I threw up a few times. Eventually It got so bad that my mom thought that I had pneumonia or something so she took me to the ER. When I was there I tested negative for the flu but I had developed a secondary respiratory infection so I had to take antibiotics. Later that same week pretty much everyone in my family along with some of my close friends got sick experiencing similar symptoms that I had, prior to me getting sick I had to go to LAX a few times (I live in LA) and I was coming into direct contact with people who had travelled. After about two weeks of getting sick I started to recover. A few weeks after I had started to recover the state of California issued a stay at home order. This got me thinking, could it be possible that me, my family and a few of my friends had contracted an early form of the coronavirus? Maybe I’m just jumping into conclusions but I had never experienced anything like that before and even now I have breathing problems.Also this was in late January - early February."
"Hello,My dad has been hospitalized for 12 days now, today we got the call that we have been dreading. He is no longer responding to treatment and will likely pass on in the next few days. He's been on a ventilator for 5 days. Early on, he went into shock and developed ARDS, and with COVID, there is a 90% mortality rate, according to his doctor. I'm a wreck and don't know what to do. The worst part is that we can't visit. Please send me words of encouragement, I want to stay strong for my family."
"First off I wanna say a huge FK YOU to this virus! This virus has completely disrupted so many lives in such a massive massive way.  It has completely destroyed the natural order of doing things.  My husband only got to see her in the ER.  FOR 10 WHOLE MINUTES and then had to leave as they wheeled her into palliative care to die *ALONE*. I have never heard a grown man cry like I have this past 24 hours like my husband.   Devastation is not the word for this.Helplessness is more like it.  And here she isn't even dying FROM COVID19, but because of it, we can't even be with her.  My other brother in law in the States cant even see her.   He can't even fly here FFS!!  All these deaths from COVID19 are such a devastation.  No words can describe the amount of heartbreak this world is experiencing."
"So I should have finished work at two this afternoon but I had to stay on all evening and all night just because somebody had a cough. I love my job but this is non stop, non stop giving up my nights and my evenings haven't had a proper meal in days! Why can't the NHS just test healthcare workers? I know the danger and I understand why this guy has had to go sick but if we could be tested then we wouldn't be losing most of our team over a cold!"
"I never get sick. Usually, regular flu is just headache lasting one evening for me, but there was one week around September/October when I had all symptoms of covid19. Including very strong shortness of breath, which stayed a little to this day. And around January, all my family and friends had very strong flu similar to covid19, my dad also died that month,  his heart stopped beating while he was in a car, but he was only 47years old and in good shape. All this was way before first case was diagnosed in my country. I also know that there were cases of lungs related diseases back in November in USA but they were all linked to vaping. How likely is it that covid19 was around way back then?"
"Short version:  My aunt owns a place in Islamorada, FL that I've leased from her for the last 6 months.  The HOA has demanded I leave the residence immediately, by tomorrow morning, or they will have me arrested.  This is the second time they've said this to me, and they claim I am an illegal occupant.  Which is not true.  My aunt is calling her attorneys, but what should I do in this case?  They have been intimidating me with legal threats like they no the cops (good ole boy type town) and that I should listen to them and leave immediately.  I'd like to leave because I am now worried for my safety, but there is literally no where to go given the current Covid pandemic.They say if I'm not gone by morning the cops will be here and arrest me and put me in jail.  They have been very direct and forceful about this, and refuse to call the homeowners whom I have a legal lease with.  They have given me no reason as to why I'm being asked to vacate other than I'm an illegal occupant, because the board never approved my lease.  They have been aware I've been here for over 6 months and have never said a word until now.I could go into the real reasons they want me gone - they want the property of my aunt who is elderly for pennies on the dollar, conract revonations to their own companies, and sell it for tons.  I am in the way as I've fixed the place up so my aunt doesn't have to sell - they've done this with many of the units here since taken over ~5 years ago.  My aunt has owned the property for over 30 years. Sorry for the long post, I am looking for advice on how I can vacate to avoid the threats they've given me, but also be able to take legal action afterwards.ANY ADVICE WELCOME and thanks for listening."

"I am curious if anyone would share what they were doing for the weeks leading up to getting covid-19? We’re you following social distancing, totally isolating yourself except grocery trips, working, etc.  I haven’t heard much about this and am super interested. If anyone could point me in the direction of if this info is being collected i would be grateful!"
"So I have a dilemma I need help with. I work for an ""essential"" business (and there's so much to unpack there but it's not super important so I will skip it). Well for the past 3 weeks it's been terrible. I was sent home when COVID first made its appearance on the news for sneezing and mild cough but hello it's allergy season. I had to healthcare facility hop to find a place and get a note to say I'm ok to return to work (meaning I didn't have COVID, that's it). I should mention that when the practitioner saw me, she told me my wheezing was bad and she heard my lungs draining. Gave me a prescription for another rescue inhaler and some pills. Well returned to work but noticed the CDC has listed asthmatics as a separate group on high risk individuals. The workplace FINALLY started to let people who are high risk work from home. My manager told me he was staying home and I told him that I'll be doing the same since I'm high risk. He told me that I couldn't because I couldn't do my job from home. I have to be there physically (again alot to unpack). I went to a primary care office to A. Get a primary care Dr. since I moved and B. Get my prescriptions a longer refill term. When I get there I do a breathing test and get xrays. Since I went to the doctor 3 weeks prior I was back on medication, my symptoms were not bad. At this point because I wasn't showing symptoms of COVID or wheezing, I felt brushed off. I was given a new daily inhaler and increased prescription refilled. Before I left I asked the doctor since asthma is listed as high risk and I still have to be out every day for work, is there a way he could provide a note saying I should be self isolating? This is the only way I'll be able to protect myself and do my part by not being out continuing the spread. I have to have a note to apply for emergency medical leave. He said asthma was not a high risk factor for developing complications from COVID and said unless I am showing signs or my asthma has worsen (which it *knock on wood* won't because I've been managing) I still have to be out. I'm not one to complain, but with everything going on I thought a medical professional would be the last person dismissing illness and saying it's ok to be out just ""wear a mask"". Is there anything I can do or am I over reacting? Should I get a third opinion? I'm only going because even though they cut our pay, it's still better than waiting who knows how long to apply for unemployment and get a fraction of money. Yes, health is more important but these are tough times. TL;DR: I'm asthmatic and a doctor told me I wasn't considered high risk. Instead, I was given more medication and told to just wear a mask not self isolate. What should I do?"
"I work in a hospital in NY state, we were way ahead of so many others in our state. We jumped on going negative pressure in whole buildings, putting up temp walls and opening whole empty buildings and getting them ready for patients. We went from using 300 to 400 beds on average but due to prepping and hard work could have close to 1,000!!! If we need them by the end of the month. I’m so proud of our people, but some sobering news, yesterday we got the models if you all do 50% SD and use masks etc and if 75% of you SD, and stay home and do what’s right. If half of you listen there is no way we could ever treat the sick that are coming our way. Like NO FUCKING way in hell 70% of you will ever get a mattress on the floor let alone med gasses, medicine or even food. We are starting to get sick now, some of us, many of us will die. At 75% we will not make it, it will be like Fukushima. Stay home, 95% of you stay the FUCK home, don’t listen to anything anyone in the media says unless it is to stay the fuck home."
I am so miserable physically and emotionally.
"This may belong in r/AMITA tl/dr ; Ex-wife wants to have birthday party/easter egg hunt for her 30 yr old son and his 6 yr old daughter.  I'm uncomfortable with my 22 yr old daughter attending.Details: My daughter (H) lives with me (and my g/f and her 2 children) now that she's home from school.  She goes 3-5 times a week to see/visit her mother who lives 10 miles away.  Her brother (C) will turn 31 on Sunday and has a six year old daughter.  H &amp; C's mother has her mother (78 poor health) living with her.  No one in the family is exhibiting any symptoms.  My ex is planning a birthday party/Easter egg hunt for C and is only inviting immediate family.  Activities should be outside, but social distancing will be next to impossible to maintain.  I am a low patient contact essential health care worker (pharmacy) but do have some interactions with patients.  H works six hours a week with me in pharmacy.  Problem; I am uncomfortable with my daughter going to this party and continuing to live/work with me.  I've voiced my concerns (via text) and have been told I'm over reacting, as they all already are having interactions and this is just one more.  Should ""stay at home"" mean stay at home, or am I overreacting? &amp;#x200B;Thanks"
"I feel that the information on actual symptoms to be wishy-washy, especially the ""sore throat"" bit. I'm interested to know what kind of sore throat this virus brings with it? I get a sore, dry throat when my heaters been on too long and I have to drink loads of water, but that is a completely different type of sore throat that you get with swollen glands or tonsillitis. You might get a sore throat from singing/shouting too much. Again this is a very different type of ""sore throat"". What's the covid19 golden symptom actually like? Does it feel like your glands are swelling? Do you get that horrible lumpy feeling in your pharynx?I would be very grateful for any descriptive answers. Descriptions of the other symptoms also welcome. Thank you :)"

"This post is a display of my mother's symptoms for the past 15-16 days dealing with COVID-19. She has ***not confirmed*** COVID-19 with a test, but all symptoms line up with this virus. Her primary physician has also deemed she has COVID-19. She has underlying asthma that she takes Montelukast 10mg daily (generic Singulair). Some of the details in the beginning stages are going to appear vague, this is simply due to lack of physical observation for her. I have been staying with her as of Friday April 3rd. March 25th - April 2nd: (Report is from calling and texting her throughout these days). Symptoms slowly increasing - headaches getting worse daily, fatigue increased gradually, fever slowly increasing per day, coughing (dry in the beginning) was increasing as well. She was self-medicating Tylenol as needed, but during this time, fatigue and headaches were setting in as the primary symptoms of complaint.**April 4th** \- 102.5 fever, extreme lethargy and frailness. Splitting headache down the center of the head, dry cough. Bed ridden most of the day, est. 23/24 hours in the day.*Started taking 2,000-2,500mg of Tylenol daily at this point, 10mL of cough syrup (bromphenir-pseudoephed-DM syrup) every 6 hours, one dosage of antibiotic (azithromycin 250mg) per day for 6 days.* **April 5th** \- main symptoms were still splitting headache down the middle of the head (10/10 on intensity she claims), fever reading between 101.2 - 101.4, coughing but sounding a bit phlegmy, extremely lethargic, only able to sit up twice in the day to take meds and eat half a bowl of soup. Lethargy may be setting in strongly due to lack of calories and hydration. **April 6th** \- 99.0 temperature at midnight, 101.0 @ 10:45am, 99.9 @ 4:25pm, headaches subsided a bit (8/10), extreme lethargy.**April 7th** \- 98.3 @ 7:45am, 101.2 @ 4pm, continuing to take roughly 2,000-2,500mg of Tylenol a day to keep fever down. This is the first time I noticed fever is peaking during the afternoon. **April 8th**  \- 98.9 @ 8am, headache back up to 10/10, headache seemed to subside a bit after laying down for 10 minutes. Noticed she was coughing quite a bit after getting up from a horizontal position. Cough is phlegmy. Has ZERO desire to get up, even to drink Gatorade or water. 97.4 temp @ 12:30pm, headaches reported as ""pings"" bouncing around her head. Reported difficulty breathing after climbing 15 stairs. 100.5 @ 8pm, cough still phlegmy but sounds like it's loosening up. **April 9th** \- 98.7 temp @ 7:45am, headache 7/10. Complained of shortness of breath again after climbing stairs, regulates after 2-3 minutes and can catch breath. 100.7 @ 6pm. Lethargy still at an extremely high level (during this day, I had to physically feed her with a spoon because she did not have the energy to lift spoon). **April 10th** \- 98.3 temp @ 7am, 7/10 headache, slightly short on breath at times. Coughing is consistent but decreasing slowly, only complains of coughs when they become uncontrollable (20-30 seconds of coughing heavily). First day she said she was feeling ""over the hump."" This is nearly 14-15 days after first reported symptoms. I hope this finds you in a good place and it helps people understand what's going on for people who have COVID at or around this age of 66. Feel free to ask questions, I will try and update with more details. I apologize if things aren't ultra clear, a lot of information in the past 7 days."
"So I have a question I’d like someone to explain to me. I read today that the US has surpassed the death toll of Italy. Before I continue, keep in mind that I’m not at all doubting the seriousness of the virus. A family member of mine had it, and I know it is real. My question is why haven’t we had the media coverage Italy had? Every day I saw pictures of Italy depicting the crisis there (the trucks carrying the bodies, etc.) I feel as if we haven’t really seen much of this in US media. If it’s worse here than it was there, why isn’t it getting as much media coverage? Is it because the US is much larger and more spread out than Italy? Or to prevent further wide-spread panic?"

"  I thought there would be some  opportunities for online training to do face-to-face counseling online with this pandemic, but the only things out there are text only counseling  which just seems totally bogus to me.

"“It has a death rate of like, 2%” “Its pointless to lose billions in wages over the flu” How do you live to be an adult with such a lack of understanding for consequences beyond yourself? Can you even call yourself an adult like???The virus spread through people who aren’t symptomatic, and it spreads to approximately 2 people for every infected person. That’s a lot. What I don’t understand is how people can make 2-3% seem so.... Small. It isn’t. 2-3% of a population of ~330 million, that is 6.6 million to 9.9 million people. That is the population of entire states. And it isn’t just fucking grandparents, it isn’t just really sick adults and kids. These are going to be normal people who won’t have access to the medical care that they need. How? Because the US has the shittiest fucking medical care in the 1st world. Millions of people are going to die because they stayed at home till the very last minute because they can’t afford medical care. People that don’t have the illness, are gonna die because ER access, is going to be even worse than it was before. No beds, no basic medical equipment for the millions of Americans who come through the ERs every day. Rural America is going to get so FUCKED because some areas don’t even have doctors and are lucky if they have a decent number of NPs and Paramedics Please. Stay inside. If you don’t care about the people around you that might be immunocompromised, or older. Think about how much better your quality of life will be if this ends soon."

"Hi everyone, I posted this message in another subreddit but thought maybe I would get more responses posting it here. I recently got a job working in the emergency department at a well-known and respectable hospital. I was super excited to get the job offer a few months ago since I still need a lot of patient contact hours to be able to apply to physician assistant school. Last week I finished my training for my position, which took me about 2 month. I also live with my parents, both in their mid to late 60s. Although I take precautions when I come home from work (like removing my shoes and showering right away) I can’t help but think I am putting them at risk for covid, especially since I come into contact with covid patients every shift. My sister and mom think I should leave my job since it’s risky right now with the virus being so contagious. Half of me thinks I should in order to protect my parents. The other half of me is hesitant since I was excited to get this job, I really need these hours to be eligible to apply to grad school this June and also because I need the money to start paying off my college loans. Just not sure what to do at this moment. If you have any ideas, suggestions etc please let me know. Thank you in advance!!"
"So my sister said two days ago that my country (Russia) will be put on quarantine probably until June. Her bf has a friend that works for the federal government and that friend gave this information to my sister's bf. Well, that's awful. So in order to not move in with my relatives again I have to find another job and I've been wondering about whether or not I should get a job at a supermarket. Because I can't work from home, I have no experience and education. Is there someone that is an essential worker and knows how to protect yourself from covid?"
"Realistically, how long will this virus last? I have seen many different statements throughout media platforms. Some say it will only be another month and then we all kind of forget about it. Others say another year due to the rate of people NOT STAYING HOME. And the amount saying that it will never end until everyone gets the virus."
"My best friend lost her grandma and her cousin to COVID-19 in the span of a week. Many more people in her family are infected, because her cousin accidentally brought it home to his wife and their kids.     I am struggling to find something I can say or do to to be there for her. Is the best I can do to just be an available shoulder when she reaches out? I'm giving her space because she says she feels lost and sad all the time, and just wants space. So that's what I'm doing---giving her space. But when she comes out of her hole (she is actually very extroverted and before this happened to her family she was struggling with the isolation of social distancing...) can I do something truly helpful?     When you were hurting and needed a friend, what was the best thing your friend did for you? Just be a shoulder and a good listener? Cook for you? Bring you booze? Take you for a drive out in the country? Have movies to watch and a comfy couch to lounge on? Make something together, be it food or anything else? Offer sidewalk chalk or coloring books? I just want to be the best friend to her I can be."
"I’ve been feeling sick lately, dry cough, sore throat, fatigue, haven’t checked my temperature so idk about fever, but i asked my job if i could self isolate and quarantine myself while getting unemployment, and after two days they demanded that i come back to work or get a doctors note. I work as a janitor sanitizing buildings and cleaning in multiple different accounts and have been exposed to multiple ”compromised” rooms (like a classroom of a teacher who tested positive for the virus, i don’t know how long its lasts lingering around rooms so idk about it being still contaminated). That’s a lot of text but my question is can they keep me working like this? they aren’t forcing me to work but they won’t lay me off, and without being laid off i can’t collect unemployment which is necessary to pay my rent and living costs. I live in Las Vegas nevada if that makes any difference. Thank you"
"Currently, 99.8% of the US Population has not been diagnosed with COVID and we are in lock-down. Assuming that we open up the lock-downs in June and the virus is still out there and there is no vaccine, won't we experience the same issue then as we have now but even worse because we aren't in lockdown?If we are trying to ""flatten the curve""...whatever that means....how is June any different than now? We won't have millions more ventilators or more hospital beds by then...so I don't understand how pushing this from today a few months out will be better.Doesn't it seem that we should stay in lock-down until a vaccine is available (not feasible at all)....or just get this over now with herd immunity?"
"I can't seem to believe my father isn't here anymore. Even if we were never close bc of things that happened between me, my mom and siblings, this last few years I tried to change and just let God guide him to a better path. We became sort of close the past 2 years. But I never got to say I forgive you. Never gave him a hug without feeling awkwardness now I find myself crying every time I remember all the promises we made together. He wasn't the best father in the world but he was the only father God gave me."
"My understanding is that the coronavirus can be safely ingested, and that its the respiratory pathways that are to be worried about.So if I can eat something that is contaminated and not contract the virus, how exactly do I contract it from my hands?"
"There is a lot of incorrect, inconsistent, and outdated information out there.6 Feet is not far enough to protect people. This is giving a false sense of security and will be a huge problem if people go back to work. The virus travels 13 feet on the air. Virus droplets occur when breathing, speaking, coughing or sneezing. How large they are and how far they travel are influenced by how they left your mouth. Yelling, singing, coughing...those types of action push forward, resulting in a longer distance.Those droplets do not all just disappear into thin air. Some waft, some disintegrate, and some float to the floor. Where they might be able to remain active.[https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885\_article](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/7/20-0885_article)&amp;#x200B;[https://www.thedailybeast.com/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-study-shows-coronavirus-can-live-on-floors-shoes](https://www.thedailybeast.com/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-study-shows-coronavirus-can-live-on-floors-shoes)"
"I got a random Hospital mask in the mail today, with my name and address on it. There was no note or anything else in the package. Just wondering if this happened to anyone else? It says it comes from net Super Market &amp; Company, 9 Rhode Island Drive, Irvine California."
I’m not going back to work for two weeks.I figure that’s long enough for people to realize the mistake and shut things down again...
"Today I was thinking about diaper wipes. I’ve seen a lot of posts about stores being out of wipes and upset parents. “There’s no wipes! My baby has a sensitive bum. I’m so angry people are buying my baby’s needs!” that word “need” There have been times where I’ve gone so broke and couldn’t afford wipes. And still to this day I go completely broke. But you know what the last thing I think about buying is? Wipes. Because guess what I have and everyone else has..? Total access to water!! Imagine that, wonderful water that is SAFE. Wipes are just a luxury. They’re not a necessity! Wet wash cloths people! And you know what your baby won’t get? A chemical rash 🤯 Do I buy wipes when I can afford them? Hell yes I do! That shit is convenient. But it’s not on my shopping list."
Like I have people (my residents) talking about how they are purposefully going out and seeing people. Making a point to hug and everything.My own coworkers seem to agree. A lot of them are Christian and proudly talking about how covid didn’t keep them from the lord.I’m also coming to realize how little people in anyway understand how illnesses work in general. People keep saying ‘how could it spread so fast?’It’s a communicable illness? That’s what they do?

They housed a total of 24 patients between February 19 and March 2. They found that the virus was most heavily concentrated on the floors of the wards, ""perhaps because of gravity and air flow causing most virus droplets to float to the ground."" Source: [RFI.fr](https://amp.rfi.fr/en/science-and-technology/20200411-coronavirus-can-travel-4-metres-twice-the-current-recommended-distance-between-people)  Found this article on: [lifeaftercv.com](https://lifeaftercv.com/forum/cv-facts/coronavirus-can-travel-4-metres-twice-the-current-recommended-distance-between-people/)"
"Theory:A combination of the following three factors, of which each has some independent evidence:* A majority of the population already has antibodies for the virus, perhaps because a less-lethal variant came through around half a year ago.* Prior exposure doesn't make you immune to the virus.* The higher the initial viral load, the more likely one is to develop a symptomatic infection.  (Not having antibodies also increases the risk.)This would explain why:* The statistics from the cruise ship showed such a high mortality rate, because in close quarters the initial viral load would be high.* The apparent symptomatic infection rate dropped so precipitously after social distancing was adopted, since this decreased initial viral load significantly even when exposure takes place.This odd combination is the only thing I can think of that would explain the screwy statistics for the virus."
"Top 10 list from a physician’s perspective The panic and mass hysteria, panicdemic, that has risen out of the COVID-19 pandemic has stretched beyond hoarding obscene amounts of toilet paper. People have unfortunate misbeliefs that are rising out of social media, misinterpretation of science, and of course panic. I do not wish to down play the severity of COVID-19 or advocate for under-reaction, however I do believe we have over reacted. This over reaction is in the way of thoughts as well as actions. The reaction to the COVID-19 has led to economic downfall, loss of jobs, loss of businesses people worked their lives to build, loss of freedom, loss of quality of life, loss of education, loss of relationships, depression, anxiety, alcoholism, and poor care for non COVID-19 patients due to neglect of every other disease process or fear from patients to present to the hospital (I am seeing this each and every day). Only time will tell if all of this was worth it. The reaction has led to many and will lead to many more lost lives in itself. I have put together a list of some of the frustrating misconceptions people have that I have seen lead to harm, not in any particular order. 1)	The purpose of social distancing is to prevent illness from COVID-19: Social distancing has become a very popular phrase that everyone know, but people do not seem to understand why it was proposed in the first place. Social distancing temporarily slows the spread of COVID-19, it does not prevent it from eventually spreading. The studies that showed social distancing is beneficial, showed that 3-18 months of social distancing is required to reduce the deaths in America from about 4 million to a more reasonable number. We have been social distancing for no more than 2 months in America and we have seen what looks like the peak of the disease. This does not mean COVID-19 deaths will stop, but at least we know the rate of spread will begin to decrease soon. If those models were accurate we would be looking at a projected minimum of 2 million deaths at this time. Thus far, we have had less than 25,000 deaths in America (I write this on April 19) and we are not projected to reach even 100,000. Clearly the models were not accurate. They raised great fear, but it is time to reassess and recognize the early projections and assumptions were not accurate. The reason the models predicted so many deaths is that they assumed overwhelming of the healthcare system. Other than a couple areas around the nation, our healthcare system has not become overburdened. Obviously those models were simple and did not take into account many factors that play a role in the spread of a contagious virus. The purpose of social distancing is to flatten the curve, this means distribute the spread of disease over a longer period of time. The longer we social distance and keep the nation closed, the more we harm every single other aspect of our nation. We need to reassess whether it is worth the harm. In medicine, we weight risks and benefits of every treatment. If the side effects are greater than the benefit it may provide, it is not a good treatment option. The aggressive approach to decrease the spread of COVID-19 has led to destruction in many parts of America. If our nation was a human body, we have provided a treatment for one organ, the lungs, but have wreaked havoc on the brain, heart, kidney, and bones. Social distancing and closure of businesses for 3-18 months has benefits, but the great destruction in many immeasurable ways outweighs that benefit. 2)	Social distancing means 6 feet apart at all times: I have seen many dramatic responses to people stepping into another’s 6 ft bubble. Most people who are out are not sick and have no illness to transmit to another person even if they were face to face. The thought that as soon as a person steps into the 6 ft bubble for less than 5 seconds to pass on the sidewalk or in a grocery store isle will lead to contraction of COVID-19 is preposterous. The fights that have developed over this, rude comments people make to one another about this, and anxiety provoked far outweighs the benefit the strict 6 ft apart has. In order for contraction of disease to occur, exposure to a COVID-19 patient is first required. Even then, contraction is not guaranteed. The risk of contraction only increases with increased time of exposure. The chances of contracting illness from a well appearing person, who would have to be asymptomatically COVID-19 positive, passing you in a parking lot is amazingly minuscule. Treating that person with disrespect or with judgement is creating social turmoil for no benefit. The media says this disease is bringing people together, I disagree. The turmoil created over strictness of social distancing has pushed neighbors, friends, and community members away from one another both literally and figuratively. 3)	Flattening a curve and eradicating a disease are the same: We need to flatten the curve of COVID-19, however people are under the assumption that the actions they take to do so will keep them safe from ever getting the virus. The truth is that many Americans will still get the virus. In 2009-2010, 60 million cases of H1N1 developed by the end of the year before the pandemic stopped. We need to develop herd immunity, which means either enough of us need to be exposed to the virus or enough of us need to be vaccinated. This will allow for enough people in the population to have antibodies to prevent illness spreading despite exposure to COVID-19. If you have had COVID-19 already and past the acute illness phase, the truth is that the rules of social distancing may not need to apply to you. Enough people contracting COVID-19 is the only way we can resume normal life before the vaccine is present. Unless you plan to strictly social distance until a vaccine is out, next spring likely, you are going be exposed and have a good chance of contracting COVID-19. 4)	COVID-19 is highly terminal and deadly: This misconception is at the heart of our panicdemic. We have no idea how many people actually have contracted COVID-19. The mortality of COVID-19 is as low as 0.1 %, but we may find that it is even lower depending on the aftermath data. The mortality is much less if a person is under the age of 65. Until we have data on the number of people who have contracted COVID-19 we will not know for certain. Just to give a couple comparisons, the H1N1 virus that caused the 2009 pandemic has a mortality rate of about 0.08% and Ebola has a mortality rate of about 25-50% and during some outbreaks it has had a mortality rate of up to 90%. The mortality of stroke, heart attack, and bacterial pneumonia are also all higher. In COVID-19, the symptoms range from nothing to death. The great majority of people who get it will not be critically sick. We have plenty of published data that young people, otherwise healthy people, pregnant woman, and even most elderly will have good outcomes after contracting the virus. The median age of death in the state that I live in is currently 85. The Median age of death from the virus nationwide is currently 75-80. It is important to note that the life expectancy in America is 78.5. It is an unfortunate but true reality that a great deal of people who have died from COVID-19 would have died from another cause either this year or in the next few years regardless. Many of these patients are ill from common diseases. I have seen, so have others around the nation who have reported this, that a patient’s cause of death is marked COVID-19 if they test positive or if it is suspected, even if they die from another cause such as heart disease, other pulmonary diseases, cancer, or stroke. This is an unfortunate truth because it will prevent us from having accurate data that we can make future decisions from. 5)	Gloves are helping me and others: Gloves do not help the general population. In healthcare we use gloves to prevent cross contamination between patients and to the health care provider in certain diseases. This only works when we take our gloves off as soon as we exit the patient’s room. Use of gloves at the grocery store or out in the community is illogical and counterproductive. Our skin has a defense mechanisms that has evolved over millions of years. The truth is that a virus will last longer on the surface of gloves than the skin. Wearing gloves around the community only carries micro-organisms from one place to another on the glove. If a person touches the face, steering wheel of the car, or other surfaces, the micro-organisms will be spread just as they would if the person was not wearing a glove. Once the glove is taken off, the hands still need to be washed in order to reduce risk for disease. Wearing a glove around the grocery store and not washing hands would be like wearing the same glove between patients in the hospital and taking it off at the end of the day to go home. If you are ok with your doctor coming in to the room wearing the same glove he/she wore with the previous patient, then it may make sense to you to continue the illogical use of gloves. Wash and sanitize hands frequently to prevent disease, any disease.  6)	Face masks will prevent COVID-19: The CDC now recommends the use of face masks in health care environments and the community based on the assumption that most people know how to properly use and manage a face mask. The goal of this is not to protect the person wearing the face mask necessarily, it is to prevent the spread of disease. The face mask does decrease the penetration of the virus through the nose or mouth somewhat depending on mask, however it does not prevent you from being able to spread the disease through the hands to the face or to the eyes. In fact, for most people, wearing a face mask leads to an increase in hand-face contact. If you wear prescription glasses in particular, it is difficult to avoid pinching at the nose when glasses fog or adjusting the mask when it falls out of place. The main goal of the mask is to prevent a sick person wearing the mask from spreading disease to those around them. If you are driving in the car alone, sitting alone at home or in your office, social distancing but talking to a neighbor, or taking a walk in the park, the mask is doing absolutely nothing but making you uncomfortable. The most important behavior is to not go out in public if you are ill, however this rule should always apply. Remember, it is at this time an assumption that public mask use will help. We have no data on this and given the increase in hand face contact, it may actually show less beneficial and more harmful. Until we have data, it is wrong to assume it is helping. A mask for all is excessive and may lead to more harm, especially in those that are not used to wearing a face mask or know how to use one. 7)	If it’s a rule, it must be right: During this pandemic, much of the information about COVID-19 has changed. The virus is novel and every day new information about it is presented in the scientific and medical literature. Those in charge are making the best decisions they can with the information that they have, but it would be naive to think they must all be the right decisions. The rules and recommendations are for the masses, however one can definitely practice safe approaches if not absolutely and stringently following the recommendations. Think of it this way. The highway speed in some places is 55mph. If a car is traveling 60mph, will the car automatically explode killing the person in it and everyone else on the road? Certainly, excessive over speeding does increase the risk for harm, but that risk incrementally goes up as the speed is increased and the length of time at the higher speed is increased. The behavior of people has become extreme. If a person talks to a neighbor but stands 4 feet apart, they are judged for it. Practicing good hygiene and smart decision making sometimes can be better than blindly abiding by every rule set without by those working with limited information. Remember the recommendations are changing constantly, are we really that arrogant, naïve, and narrow minded to think that what is thought to be true now will always be thought to be true? 8)	COVID-19 is unlike anything we have seen before: As a physician, I have seen my fair share viruses and contagious diseases. This virus is novel, however viruses are not new. We have dealt with pandemics before, we have seen worse viruses before, and we have seen more contagious virus before. Consider the Spanish flu virus (H1N1 Influenza), Ebola virus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, small pox virus, hepatitis virus, and many more. The approach to each virus needs some adjustment, however the mentality that we have never seen anything like this before is false. The aspect of this pandemic that is absolutely unique is the reaction people and governments have had to it. 9)	Pestering judgments, slander on social media, and tattle telling is helpful: People that have the capacity to make decisions are allowed to make their own decisions. This has always been true in our medical system. Sometimes, these decision are not what I agree with, but I respect the decision made by the person if they understand the risks. If a patient has a treatable and possibly curable cancer, it is up to that person to decide whether he or she wants to undergo the grueling treatment. Sometimes, it does not make sense for the person after considering the quality of life issues, expenses, and possible limited benefit out of the treatment. Pestering them with judgments about their decision does not improve their quality of life. Certainly, many times, it does not change their mind. Even if one’s mind is changed, the source of the decision change is to appease someone else. Judgement of your neighbors, friends, family, and community members will not help anyone. Many of us have the same access to information gained through media and it is unlikely a person has not heard about COVID-19 or social distancing. The medical community has access to more facts and untwisted data, such as journal articles from the New England Journal of Medicine, however most people outside of the medical community have the same understanding about the virus and its effects. The interpretation of that data will be different for people, even in the medical community, this is unavoidable. Forcing judgement will only lead to domestic turmoil, loss of friendships, and frustration from all. 10)	COVID-19 is the most dangerous and common disease healthcare workers are dealing with: This is probably the most frustrating aspect of this pandemic from my perspective. The US has 650,000 deaths per year attributed to heart disease. Another 600,000 deaths come from cancer, 170,000 deaths from accidents, and 150,000 deaths from stroke. The total deaths per year between these more common diseases reaches over 1.5 million. These numbers do not even take into account the permanent disability without death that these illnesses cause. COVID-19 leads to illness, however if one lives (as most do), there is minimal to no long term effects usually. Again, as mentioned before, COVID-19 has led to &lt; 25,000 deaths as it stands and it will likely reach not too far from 100,000 in America.  Many other diseases exist and the medical community deals with these diseases every day. The notion that fighting COVID-19 is absolutely heroic and astonishing is absolutely absurd. It is difficult to deal with a pandemic and it will lead to many deaths, however evaluating and treating a COVID-19 patient should be seen no differently than treating other patients with contagious diseases. We doctors took an oath to care for patients. Nowhere in that oath do I remember an exemption to do so when a patient has COVID-19. We have a duty to our patients, no matter the disease, and I have seen this pandemic cause people to lose sight of this. We will have more pandemics and we will lose lives to those too. There still is a world outside of COVID-19. We must begin to take our COVID blinders off and see the world as a whole again. To refer to an earlier analogy, if we forget about all organs of the body and only focus on a single one, we will see the destruction of those other organs that are neglected."
"I haven't smelled for over a month!!! I'm worried it will never come back... Has anyone else experienced this? It's scary and the loss of smell was PROFOUND -- one day I could taste &amp; smell, the next day, it was like someone had turned off a light. I've had a loss of smell since March 20th. It is now April 21st. Here's the back story: My whole family was refused testing because we all got it early-on in the pandemic. My 10 year old was the first to get it in early March. She had all the symptoms without the pneumonia (fatigue for 2 weeks, fever of 102\*F, dry cough,she couldn't taste for a few days, diarrhea). Then my 8 year old got it, but was only tired for one day (he slept that whole day and night, but no fever) and the next day he was fine with no other symptoms except very mild loose stools at the end. Next my husband got it and he was in bed for two whole days with fatigue (slept through two days) and had a dry cough. No fever though, but he lost his sense of smell and I made fun of him because the dog could fart and he couldn't smell it. And then it was my turn to get some weird symptoms. I'm 7 months pregnant, but all the symptoms that I got were consistent with a very mild, but lengthy cold. Felt like I had a mild cold for about 2 weeks. No cough, no fever, no pneumonia... I had a half day of being tired, but I didn't take any naps -- I just chalked it up to pregnancy symptoms plus the long cold. Then, about a week later, I get NO sense of smell. The last thing I remember tasting was coffee ice cream the night before, and then.. NOTHING. I couldn't smell gasoline at the gas station, I couldn't smell food burning in the oven. Nothing. My sense of smell STILL hasn't come back (My taste seemed to come back after about 2 weeks, so I \*can\* taste sweet, sour, bitter, salty, spicy, etc... But I cannot taste any flavor whatsoever. Mostly, I'm really worried my sense of smell might never come back! Has anyone else had this happen with Covid-19 and how long did it take for your flavor and sense of smell to come back?"
"Being panicked about breathing is natural. Most of all asthma deaths have been a result of panic to the stage of shock at which point the body closes down.As an asthma sufferer, I am a veteran of that sense of panic but managed to find my way through it.My father informed me many, many years ago of a way of breathing called...[Diaphragmatic breathing](https://www.health.harvard.edu/lung-health-and-disease/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing)Let your chest relax and breathe using your stomach. Allow the diaphragm to do its job.When the diaphragm is concave (tummy distended), the lungs inhale.When the diaphragm is convex (tummy contracted) the lungs exhale.You can practice this by placing your hand on your stomach and watching it raise and lower while you inhale and exhale.I hope this helps everybody, especially those in respiratory distress.It works. Believe me, during some of my darkest asthmatic hours, this method enabled me to relax and simply breathe."

"I’ve been seeing the recent protests, people no longer want to #stayhome. I’m afraid that people don’t understand what’s happening, and if they did, they would feel differently.Let me just start by saying I am always suspicious of the media. I almost never trust what they say, and I try to avoid even watching the news. When all of this started, I was furious that the media was causing such hysterics. I even said “it’s just a flu.” I was wrong.Im not a doctor, I’m a registered nurse and I work ER and ICU. I’m not here to tell you HOW it’s different from the flu or argue about WHY this is causing such a problem. I just want to give people a glimpse into my life right now.I work at a community hospital. Before COVID-19 we had 16 ICU beds. Our ER would see some critically ill patients, but would be full, for the most part, with people who were moderately ill with common illnesses (COPD, CHF, pacreatitis). My world has been turned upside down. At one point we were intubating 5-7 people a day. People walk into the ER, looking ok, an hour later they have a tube down their throat, and a few hours after that, they are as good as dead. Before corona, I had witnessed about 10 deaths in my 3 years at this hospital. My reality now, is that I’m wrapping bodies everyday. 6 in the last 3 days. And that’s just MY patients. We have opened up 3 new ICUs. We now have over 50 ICU beds and EVERYONE is dying. We are intubating people because they cannot breath on their own. But once they are intubated, they have about an 80% chance of death (and that’s being generous). There’s no family allowed in the hospital. Most days I’m thankful for that. Because the mere site of my hospital right now is traumatizing, even for me. I’m not even sure if they can view the body at the funeral home. Your loved one walks into the hospital, and you never see or speak to them again. I am bombarded with phone calls from family members all day long. I am desperately searching for the words to tell them that there is no hope, that they need to let go. But they don’t understand, no one understands what this disease is doing.I’m tired. We’re tired. We’re afraid this will never end. “I can’t handle this anymore” is something I hear from my coworkers almost everyday. We’re tired of telling people they will wake up and then wrapping them in plastic days later.I don’t have the answers. But if there is even a chance that you could make a difference, wouldn’t you take it?But instead, I see more and more people on the roads, discussions about the economy, and protests against quarantine. Maybe it’s me who doesn’t understand."

I can think of nothing more than fighting for a good cause even if there is a huge health or safety risk. What do you all think or have seen? Any potential nursing students turned off by this Pandemic? Anyone change their mind as a result?"

"My wife and all her colleagues caught Covid-19 early in March. It was impossible to avoid catching it from her as she is one of the ""we probablay have all had it recently"" brigade. I realised symtoms on 26th March, about 5 days behind my wife. She sailed through it but was made very weak and coughed more than me. The virus got me reasonably badly. It finds at least 2 receptors enabling it to attack differing cell types. It will get at dozens of areas of the body and has various ways of destroying cells in areas where the recipient is vulnerable.&amp;#x200B;A tuely nasty, small DNA, little virus.&amp;#x200B;I found no high temperature but my readings ranged from 0.1 celcius over hyperthermia to 0.1 just under a bad fever, the range fluctuating hourly. My blood oxogen percentage went low often and kept very varied hourly. I was down to 87% at the worst point. I was sore in many places including the testis, which we will soon find is a problem factor. I think young men will get hit hard with this and may have reduced sperm counts forever afterwards ? We will see.&amp;#x200B;As I have hypertension, I was hit badly with heart racing and 200 over 120 pressure. I normally get high peaks but this was despite my 3 types of tablets, and, it went on for about 20 minutes. It seems the virus has so wide a spectrum of potential cell damage that it enhances many existing weaknesses. I can understand how people have died with heart attacks as it felt like I was beginning to have one at one point. It came with little warning.&amp;#x200B;The main thing about it is that it comes and goes, so daily you feel you may be OK, but over weeks it keeps returning and making you feel either sick, breathless or feeling like you have just had a sudden shock.&amp;#x200B;It is reported to let you have a week or 10 days of symptoms, similar to flu, lets you feel OK, then hits you with its worst a day or two later. I found this was the case for me.&amp;#x200B;Now a whole month after initial symtoms I am experiencing:&amp;#x200B;Weakness which comes quickly after doing work,&amp;#x200B;Nausea but only mild,&amp;#x200B;Bruising very easily,&amp;#x200B;Small sores where slight irritation existed in the past,&amp;#x200B;Loss of taste and smell,&amp;#x200B;Aches in most parts of the body for a few hours but the positions change regularly,&amp;#x200B;Poor sleep,&amp;#x200B;Abnormal eating and toilet behaviour, hunger and weight gain.&amp;#x200B;\&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;It certainly seems to get at you in many different ways, but with me it was not severe, or significantly fever related, breathing was difficult but never frightening. Sleeping had to be recumbent, horizontal was not possible.&amp;#x200B;I am sligty overweight, should be 74 kilos but am 79, don't smoke, eat healthily, never drink alcohol or do drugs, and have quite severe hypertension. I am 65 yoa."
"It’s totally understandable that people are wanting to protest extended lockdowns, but I think anger and frustration is being misplaced. If the government did a better job of making citizens feel financially secure during this time, surviving a two month lockdown should not be that difficult. Instead, partisan politics and the need to continue to feed big business are coming first. If people want to be angry, be angry that your government doesn’t care enough about you to let you stay home and be safe from this virus.Unless my math is wrong, if all of the 26 million people filing for unemployment (keep in mind, that number was lower a few weeks ago) were to receive a $3000 per month check, you could pay all of those people for TWO months and it would cost $156 billion. There are an estimated 126 million working adults in the US. If you gave ALL of them $3000 for 2 months, that would cost $756 billion.The $2.2 trillion stimulus package only gave people a one time $1200 payment, and that likely included a lot of people that didn’t really need it (including my dead grandma), and loans to large companies that were meant to help small mom and pop operations. Even if you did want to give out loans to small companies still, you could, and probably stay well within that $2 trillion number, and give people a lot more security.[Europe's Economy Was Hit Hard Too, But Jobs Didn't Disappear Like In The U.S.](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/23/838085670/europes-economy-was-hit-hard-too-but-jobs-didn-t-disappear-like-in-the-u-s)"

"Never thought in a million years that an international emergency will divide these relationships instead of strengthening them.Both of my brothers, 27-35 years of age, don't believe that there is a virus in the first place. It's like a big joke to everyone apart from health care professionals and business owners. They believe that it's all an exaggerated hoax with some secret agenda behind it.I have to explain over and over again why I can't go to their house, visit their kids and so on. I live in a house with 5 other people. My boyfriend is asmathic and I don't have the freshest lung myself as a heavy smoker.My housemate broke our socializing rules and went to a house party overnight despite his full awareness of the situation. We live in Ireland, and not in a place with the most cases, but regardless, everyone is aware. I'm very angry at the fact and expressed it to him but there's no regret on his part. I'm just at a loss, I've been overwhelmed and crying because of how little they give a shit and the arguments that break out over it. Our neighbours lost both their mothers to the virus. My brother has kids and I'm worried to death because he has heart problems himself and his wife has serious weight issues. All I've kindly asked of them is to be reasonable and keep distance and respect my distancing choices and to just sit in your pants for another few weeks. There's no real freedom lost, you can go for food shops, you can go outside for walks, you can relax at home which is a chance of a lifetime. But the conspiracies on the internet have taken my brothers over, and my housemate just frankly doesn't care. This virus is vicious and we truly don't understand it yet, not even the long term implications of contracting it. But to deny that it exists in the first place just hurts my heart, and the poor healthcare people who have to suffer because of people like this is just infuriating.I don't know what to do, I don't know what to say. I don't want to lose any of them just because they're being stupid. I work in a large grocery store but the distance isn't always possible to keep. Im so afraid to get my coworkers and customers sick because my housemate can't just refuse a house party or because my brothers don't believe in any of it. I can't escape from it and the impact it would have if they were to catch it is immense. Their families and coworkers would be sick. It's impossible for them to keep the distance at their work. I don't even know what advice can I ask for or what I expect from posting it here, I guess I just needed to shake my pain out somewhere. I haven't even told the rest of the house that the other housemate was off to a house party, and had gone to the town of most infections in our area just to go for a drive beforehand. I didn't even give my nephew a gift for his birthday because we had all agreed that there will be no socializing. I just feel like a piece of crap.tl;dr : my brothers believe the virus is a hoax and my housemate doesn't care and goes to house party over night, this is damaging to our relationships"
"I work in the hospital and it feels great when I hear Alecia keys and journey songs come on that means people have survived and are going home.

"Hello everyone, I want to start off by saying that I’m not trying to insult americans or anyone for that matter. For those of you that don’t know what it looks like in sweden right now: * 2274 deaths as I’m writing * 18926 confirmed cases (It’s obviously more but we arent’t really counting) * Schools are open for everyone younger than those born in 2004 * Pretty much everything is still open* Maximum amount of peope in a gathering is 50* No social distancing * Hospitals is not overfloodedAs you can see, we’re pretty much living normally. We do have a spread though, but it’s not servere at all, even though we haven’t taken any serious procussions. If you compare this to USA, who absolutely take serious procussions, still have A LOT of more cases and deaths. Yeah, obviously USA is a bigger country with more people, but Swedens curve is going down already, while USA:s curve is just starting to go down after more than a million cases. How is this even possible, what are you doing over there in USA? How could there be such a great spread even though they are barely allowed to go outside or meet other people?Sources:Personal observationshttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/sweden/"
"[Social Distancing](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a31460746/coronavirus-covid-19-social-distancing/) The **REAL** reason for social distancing is to limit an overwhelming strain on the health care system. Social distancing and quarantine is theoretically **NOT** meant to reduce the **NUMBER** of infections, or for that matter hospitalizations and deaths. Social Distancing spreads out the length of time that COVID occurs from say 3 months to \~18 months. This allows the health care system to prepare and not be overwhelmed. Now in real life if the health care system is not overwhelmed then a reduced death rate would be expected. The general thought and news headline alludes to a reduced number of infections secondary to social distancing and quarantine. It's a straight forward easy to understand read complete with a cartoon. Enjoy."
God loves you. He doesn't want you going around putting yourself and others at risk. You can worship from home. Take this time to reconnect with your beliefs rather than weaponizing them during such a crucial time. Your first amendment rights do not supersede human life. You stress the importance of human life and the human soul yet turn around and protest and leave your homes despite knowing it could kill. God will understand if you have to worship from your homes with your family.  He wont if you deliberately cause the loss of human life.
"Covid 19 is an interesting disease. It has been almost 8 months only and we are on 3M cases and declared pandemic. Sheesh! That leads me to believe though, that it is an alien virus. Here’s my theory. For years we have been waiting for aliens to visit us. Yet we have still seen no actual proof of any aliens on Earth being present. They haven’t visited us. Or have they? If we want to come close to solving that and to prove my point we have to crack that, if there are aliens, are they smarter than us? If you are Muslim you will know what I will talk about in the next 2 lines (I’m Muslim sooo...) Allah says in the Quran in a verse I do not remember, he says though “Allah considers humans above many creatures” but not all.............that is a religious point already cracked. Now we know that yes there are more intelligent aliens out there. So smart their tech is incomprehensible.  Maybe aliens are already among us.... handing. They probably disguised themselves with some tech do disguise as humans. Keep in mind they are not intelligent. If aliens are among us tho, they don’t match as same entities. They have unidentified skin and things like that. They would radiate a virus instantly that couldn’t be cured. They would also catch a disease. If they live among us they know our diseases therefore knowing our disease’s cures... but not us. This is their plot to destroy humanity. When the time is right,  they expose themselves and boom. Incurable pandemic. Thanks for reading"

"Less than a month ago I posted that my father contracted COVID-19, he was in the ICU 12 days and we were told he wasn’t going to make it. He went into septic shock and had multi organ failure. Since we couldn’t visit, we arranged for our priest to visit him and do the holy oil blessing to pass on. After this encounter, my dad’s health turned around, two days ago they were finally able to remove him off the ventilator, he now had a tracheostomy and is breathing better. He’s been slowly waking up from a monthlong coma. Yesterday we saw him open his eyes for the first time. We didn’t know if he could hear us so we asked, if you can hear us blink 2 times, and he did!!!! I still can’t believe it.  My dad still has a very long road to recovery.

"My grandfather died recently because of COVID. Technically we can’t be sure where he got it from because a lot of people around him could have had it, but we were told that his physical therapy place was shut down due to one or more people with cases of COVID. Also my mother who apparently is told everything about where my grandparents go was not told when my grandparents came over to our house and when they invited my family (I stayed home) to their house that he had been going to physical therapy still even though it was at the point where it wasn’t safe to go outside (especially where I live, NYC). Shortly after my grandfather got sick, my parents tested COVID positive and I had symptoms although never got tested (the doctors that me and my family spoke to said if my parents texted positive then I probably had it, including if I’ve had certain symptoms that I’ve never had before).I don’t care if I had it or not and I’m glad I’m getting better, and I’m glad my parents got better. I just can’t help but think that this could have been avoided. I don’t know how much pain my grandfather was in as far as if he needed to urgently go to physical therapy, so maybe he had to go. And I’m guessing my grandmother didn’t tell people about this because she didn’t want people to worry. If my grandfather got COVID from his physical therapy place then I hope it wasn’t because there weren’t necessary precautions in place. Worst comes to worst maybe my grandmother didn’t even tell us he was going out to physical therapy because she thought he wouldn’t get sick, as the “this could never happen to us” mentality is prevalent in my family. Although this mentality has been used in serious family situations, I’m hoping that this wasn’t the case and I personally think that this part of my family is brighter than that knowing that this is a global pandemic. I wish certain places closed down sooner than they did, and that each place of business took necessary precautions. And I wish that my grandparents never stepped out of their house during all of this and found a way for my grandfather to get the help he needed at home instead, plus get groceries delivered to their house instead of going to the store. My family has breathing problems and my grandmother has immune and thyroid problems (she actually tested positive for COVID as well, but is better now. Things could have been worse but I’m thankful they weren’t). Sometimes I think this could have been avoided in so many ways, but I really don’t know. It seems even more sad considering my grandfather got over so many serious injuries and beat cancer within the past 10 or so years and this is what killed him. I can only hope that he’s in a better place now, and that both individuals and businesses take precautions necessary so COVID doesn’t spread.Edit: thank you to those who responded kindly"
"Twitter: Jimmy John's Workers United (@JimmyWorkers)Stand with us and sign the petition here: [jjpetition](https://www.change.org/p/d-d-management-stand-with-jimmy-john-s-workers-keep-employees-and-customers-safe?recruiter=1085418950&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=copylink&amp;utm_campaign=tap_basic_share)About a week and a half ago my co-workers and I were made aware of management’s decision to open the lobby to the public starting on April 28th, 2020.  I, along with three others, disagreed with this substantially for many reasons.  Over the week the four of us created a petition with the help of a specialist who we give many thanks to.  After we finished finalizing our petition we went and talked to our co-workers and gained as many signatures as we could.  On Monday, May 4th of 2020, we delivered a majority petition to our bosses; demanding they put people over profits.  My co-workers and I are afraid for our lives and the lives of our customers and loved-ones.   Customers are coming in with no masks on and the plexiglass barriers are not effective for us or our customers seeing how many of us are taller than the barriers.  And even with the markers being six feet apart there is no way for us or our customers to practice social distancing due to our restaurant being a small and enclosed building.So many of my co-workers are being negatively affected by this pandemic and the decision to open our lobby to the public.  We have people taking bathroom or lunch breaks to just breakdown and cry from the stress.  This is unacceptable.  Work used to be a place where we come and enjoy each other's company and conversations; a place to have fun and relax, yet now so many of us are anxious to even step foot inside.  Just because we are in the middle of a pandemic does not make it any less severe and people need to realize that COVID-19 is still highly contagious and dangerous.  My personal reason for signing this petition is with customers being allowed in our lobby I have a higher risk of becoming infected.  I then have to go home to my sister and risk getting her sick.  Since we are both immunocompromised we could essentially die from this virus.  I want Jimmy John's to keep the lobby closed.  To keep us, our customers, and our loved ones safe.  The benefit is not worth the risk.  Here is our petition:We, the undersigned workers of Jimmy John’s are concerned about the COVID-19 Health Crisis and are worried about how our current work situation is putting us and others directly in harm’s way.We do not feel it is safe to be allowing customers to continue coming into the lobby when the CDC and medical community agree that we have not yet even reached the peak of this crisis.  Even with the few precautions that management has taken to make things safer, the reality is that our store is a small enclosed space, COVID-19 is highly contagious, and cases in Utah are continuing to rise by the hundreds each day.  Also, our state does not have regularly accessible testing so the actual number of confirmed cases and deaths is likely far higher than what they are now.  We understand that sales are down, but we believe that management must put the lives of its customers and staff over its own profit.  If one of us gets sick and is unable to take paid time off or the lobby is opened then they have a significantly greater risk of spreading the virus to the rest of the staff and to customers.We cannot in good conscience put ourselves, our families, and our customers at even greater risk by keeping the lobby open and increasing the amount of direct contact that could likely spread the contagion further.  Also, because there is only one door into the store, opening the lobby is especially dangerous for delivery drivers who must be moving through the lobby to pick up orders.Consequently, we respectfully and formally request that Jimmy John’s make immediate improvements to our paid time off and workplace health and safety policies.  Specifically, that the lobby not be opened until:  1. A 14-day consecutive decline in newly confirmed cases in Utah and there is consistent statewide day-to-day testing.2. Up to a month of employer-paid sick leave if we show symptoms of the COVID-19 virus.3. Plexiglass barries that are tall enough to actually block any particulates that may pass at face level, and markings on the floor that are actually six feet apart.We engage in this collective, concerted activity under the protection of Federal Law, and we urge our local communities to engage in this effort to keep our families, communities, and essential workers safe.&amp;#x200B;Tomorrow, May 6th of 2020, the four of us along with any of our co-workers who wish to join us will be sitting down with the owner of Jimmy John's to discuss our petition and our demands.We are willing to do whatever it takes to protect our lives, our customer's lives, and the lives of our loved ones.  We are standing together.Solidarity!"
"Ok, I could be overreacting so hears my story:I am a fairly new employee at a non-profit Senior Community Center before this lockdown started here in California.  Our center has been closed for almost two months.  My boss had a great idea to allow some seniors to come and participate in a daily exercise class, but he first called it a secret workout, he now refers to it as a private workout.  They require for the participants to.keep 6 feet apart and wear a mask.  He is not requiring me to come to work, however I have so many reasons against this, and I have voiced my concerns to him as well as my other supervisor.  I can continue to work from home but they will continue doing the secret classes.  California's stay at home order has not been lifted.  Seniors are our most at risk.  Our county is small but still sees a good number of cases each day. There has to be liability, even if they have participants signing a liability waiver.  His justification is that the center is there to get seniors out of isolation, and I get that.  Depression and loneliness in the elderly is a big problem.  My boss is also one of those going to Rally's to reopen the state, in large groups, without masks on.  He is seen on TV at the last event, 2 days before the first secret class.   I am not so concerned with getting sick myself, I know I will get exposed at some point.  1. I'm worried about the seniors and their health. (And I don't think it is smart to have seniors workout while wearing a mask, it's hard to breathe just walking around let alone exercising).   2. Is this even legal, can we get fined or shut down if anyone finds out?  Ok Reddit, go... Am I overreacting?"
I can only see total numbers. How many people have recovered and how many are infected right now. It seems like media wanta to make people scared and so they only report the total numbers.
"I don’t know how much longer I can take thisThis pandemic is stringing me to my limits.I work at a hardware store so I am still working as an essential service. We have precautions at my work but no ppe to speak of so we try our best to keep the 6 foot rule.The last few weeks have been a nightmare. In my province we are doing really well so people are getting more comfortable but most people still are not working and have extra money from the government and extra time. This has lead to chaos at my store.I have pallets coming down that have no home on the floor so no where to go and cluttering my aisles. I can’t put them back up because every spare moment I have three customers waiting for help. I have stacks of “call back requests” as our online orders have been through the roof. Our phone lines are so congested they are failing and the ones that do get through cannot get to the department as we are too busy so our customer service staff are being verbally abused daily.I am finding it hard to cope at the best of times, and when every customer is angry because of the wait to get in the store, the wait to be helped, and whatever else is going on in there life only to be told we don’t have a product and have no sweet clue when we will have it is destroying me.Just needing to vent. I’m struggling with family that is older and I don’t know how long they have left and I can’t even see them. I feel so tired."

Please be sure to follow guidelines on how to properly wear a mask.

"We have had 72,000 deaths as a result of Covid 19.Over 75% were over the age of 65 or over 50,000 people.Only 0.05% of the deaths were people under 17 or fewer than a few hundred, a lot less but obviously still too many.My  question is this. What if the situation were reversed. What if we knew that over 50,000 children in America were  going to die in the next 2 months, would we allow people to go to the  beach without masks?  WTF?  Why the disparity?  Do we not care about our elderly?  Why are we not giving guidance to the portion of the general public that doesn't understand the dangers and how to mitigate them?  Why are we not striving with every breath to distribute and wear masks?  WTF is going on?"
Someone please let me know if I’m bugging out.My job is an essential business and has been open for the duration of covid. We have someone who had covid let’s say the middle of March. The business was shut down for a week then opened up. Which was already strange to me because they were only closed for 7 days while my dads job closed for two weeks. Someone else at the job caught covid AGAIN in April and they closed again for less than two weeks. How is the place even able to run after two cases at the job alone. May I also mention that the way we work is very physically close to each staff member. Are there just not any rules to cover this yet or is this something that would be reported. I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news but this is so unhealthy for every other employee working.
"This is purely a public information post. Herein I intend to correct any misinformation spread by the popular “PLANDEMIC” video. I will do so using research and links to articles. I will summarize the info in bullets, then explain in depth beneath. Please give it a read if you’ve seen the video.Summary: -Judy Mikovits was forced to remove her article from Science because she lied and misrepresented her data.-The NIAID didn’t hide anything, they disseminated the info, the average person simply didn’t read it at the time.-Medical examiners are being told to list Covid-19 on the death certificates because if someone was in stable condition with COPD or another illness, and died from ARDS suddenly during the pandemic, it was most likely covid related, and there aren’t enough tests available to use on everyone. They do the same thing with flu deaths every year.-The flu vaccine didn’t give anyone covid, vaccines have had h1n1 in them for years without causing pandemics. -An article from 2017 did find that getting a vaccine could increase your chances of catching a coronavirus. But, they were not studying THIS strand, not the pandemic strand. (there are many strands with many different degrees of severity, and have been for years) That is a very important distinction.-Hydroxychloroquine is a great option for certain patients, but it has side effects, for some patients it can kill them. Until more scientific study is done on its effectiveness, dosage, and side effects, it is very unsafe to recommend for broad usage.Links and more correction info below if you’re interested.—-———————————————————#1Judy Mikovits was forced to retract her article in Science because she lied and misrepresented her data.https://www.nature.com/news/2011/111005/full/news.2011.574.html I’m adding the link to the article that Science retracted because I understand that a news article may give people pause about the legitimacy of it. https://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6063/1636.1—-———————————————————#2Just because a YouTube video says the NIAID is hiding things and the average person doesn’t keep up on virology and new viruses until there’s a pandemic, doesn't mean they're hiding things. This is the article in Nature: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618817 and here is the press release: https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/new-coronavirus-emerges-bats-china-devastates-young-swine Additionally, here are two webpages that show the relationship between the NIAID and China--again, not trying to hide it from anyone.https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/niaid-research-china  https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/us-china-collaborative-biomedical-research-program —-———————————————————#3The reason medical examiners are being told to list Covid-19 on the death certificates is not because they’re trying to inflate the numbers, it’s because there aren’t enough tests for every person. Due to that, if someone had COPD (or CF) etc. and were stable, and then came into the hospital and died because of ARDS, it is likely that the contributing disease to your death was Covid-19. This is also how flu deaths are reported. Most people who contract the flu and die, don’t die directly from the flu, they die from pneumonia caused by the flu.The claim that doctors are being incentivized to say their patients have Covid-19 is misleading. The hospitals receive the money from Medicare, not the doctor. These are payments that Medicare has agreed to pay for patients with those diagnoses. The 20% add-on is part of the CARES Act—the same act that enabled the stimulus check.This is not to say that it is impossible that some hospital administrators may be pressuring doctors to gain more resources for their hospitals. It is however to say that that possibility is only conjecture whereas we know with evidence that applying reasonable diagnoses based on symptoms at death has been common practice with the flu for yearshttps://www.aha.org/advisory/2020-04-16-coronavirus-update-cms-releases-guidance-implementing-cares-act-provisions  —-———————————————————#4The claim that Italy was hit harder and suffered worse because they received a vaccine with the H1N1 strand is false. The trivalent (3 strands) flu vaccine that we have been getting for years has the H1N1 (influenza A) in it. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/quadrivalent.htm—-———————————————————#5The article she talks about at the end — about the influenza vaccine from 2017-2018 increasing your odds of getting coronavirus is true—that is what it found, but it didn’t look at THIS strand, and the family of coronaviruses has been around for years. The article also says that a previous study found no association between the flu vaccine and the coronavirus. Article:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107973/—-———————————————————#6Hydroxychloroquine is a great option for certain patients, but it has side effects. It is anecdotal (based on personal accounts rather than facts or research) if there hasn’t been a scientific study to determine if it is effective. Dr. Fauci isn’t saying it’s not a possible treatment, he’s saying the side effects can harm some people so until it’s studied further it’s not at all ready for broad use or recommendation.-————————————————————Thank you for taking the time to read this,Stay safe everyone-VanSome portions of this post were drawn from a write up by: Meagan Helmick PhD (in Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research), MPH, CHES"

"At 4 years old, my daughter manifested symptoms that baffled general practitioners, internal medicine, and all pediatricians except one. At first symptoms looked like tonsillitis, an ear infection, or strep. But no amount of amoxicillon or acetaminophen would bring the fever down or relieve throat pain or swelling of neck glands.  She grew more and more lethargic, her lips developed deep deep cracks in them, and when bathed, the outer layer of skin on the bottoms of her feet and the palms of her hands would sluff off.  Going into the second AND third week she developed a fine fine red rash all over her extremities, and the whites of her eyes turned tomato read. My husband was a nurse so I tapped all medical resources I could find to listen to me and help my child.  I refused to keep pumping her full of antibiotics, and I knew I was loosing her.  NO ONE in the medical field knew what it could be.  I would just hold her and cry frantic to help her.  Until one day, of all things, i happened to be listening to the Dr Dean Edell talk show,  and a woman proceeded to describe to the letter the same symptoms my daughter was experiencing.  And to her, Dr. Edell responded, your child has Kawasaki syndrome, an auto immune disease!   OH MY GOD!  an answer to my prayers!  I was now armed to get help.  This monster had a name and I was able to solicit a pediatrician that took one look at my daughter and confirmed the diagnosis!  He said she should have been in the hospital 2 weeks before!  It causes aneurysms, liver damage, vascular damage around the heart. My daughter by the grace of God, overcame this frightening disease but was immediately tested for long term damage.  (Her immune system was  forever compromised since then.)  This occurred in 1987 and was not related to covid19; HOWEVER, the symptoms related to Kawasaki Syndrome are the same as described in tandem with covid19 in children.  I am urging all parents that if you notice these symptoms, BE VIGILANT!  BE PERSISTENT. BE YOUR CHILD'S ADVOCATE AND DON'T GIVE UP UNTIL A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL LISTENS!   USE YOUR GUT!"

"I’d like the option of taking hydroxychloroquin so I can return to work. A staffer at the white house tested positive for Coronavirus and the only thing president Trump is doing to make sure he doesn’t get is take hydroxychloroquin and zinc vitamins. No socially distancing himself by 6 feet. No mask. No gloves. Just one medication and a vitamins supplement! If that’s all it takes, I’d like this option too. This is a x [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanPandemics/comments/gmzcqb/can_we_take_hydroxychloroquin_and_go_back_to_work/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) from the sub r/AmericanPandemics"
"Why is it that I am seeing so many Christians who don’t care about social distancing? Somehow, the quarantine protesters and the people refusing to wear masks call themselves soldiers of God. Somehow, we have people going outside of their homes, pressuring other people to go to work without a mask, and not caring whatsoever about other people’s safety. They judge others for being “anxious” about such a “small thing.” Some claim that the virus is government hoax or that the virus was sent to punish the “unbelievers.” They claim they are the hands and feet of the God of love. They are no soldiers. They are cowards. They are hands and feet of their own desires. How cowardly to not face a changed life for the sake of others. They chant “love your neighbor as yourself” quite frequently. However, the “sinners” and “nonbelievers” they talk about are the ones who act upon it. They are the ones helping the poor and most vulnerable.Atheists, if you are reading this, please don’t assume that this represents our God. It’s time for Evangelicals to stop being Evangelicals and start being Christians.Sorry for the long rant, but there are few people who piss me off more than people who misrepresent Jesus Christ. What people don’t realize is many of the ideas that Jesus introduced were considered quite liberal. If those ideas were the same ideas most Christians reflected nowadays they’d probably be considered liberals or moderates. Or at least conservatives with good intentions. Over 2000 years, our religion has only become more skewed."
" COVID Is Still Raging in Texas. Time to Open the Bars, Leaders Say."
I’ve had it since i got tested and was positive 4/23. I also still can’t smell all the way i don’t think. Anyone else have these symptoms? How long did they last?
"Many republicans/evangelicals and other groups believe (or profess to believe in) what they ***want to be true or what is expedient to be true*** \-- if it is in opposition to the best scientific evidence, then they will seem antiscience but they don't just say, ""Oh, scientists say this, so I will believe the opposite.""But they will downplay the importance of credentials -- many dumb people do that: ""My opinion is just as valid as that of some expert...""Anyway, this wishful thinking/magic thinking has led to all sorts of nonsense:1. Power of crystals (is that what they call it? whatever, that crystals have healing power)2. Snake handling/speaking in tongues, other religious nonsense3. Power of prayer in healing4. *Hydroxychloroquine*"
"Hello Everybody,During, this covid-19 crisis, we all are facing so many hardships. There is a petition site called change.org, where you can start a petition and bring your problem in attention to everybody. Today, I was going through this site and I came across several petitions associated with Indian migrant workers. With factories and workplaces shut down due to the lockdown imposed in the India, millions of migrant workers had to deal with the loss of income, food shortages and uncertainty about their future. Many of them and their families have gone hungry. Millions of them began walking back home, with no means of transport due to the lockdown. Even today many of them are walking home (1). These people are really poor and desperation have caused them to walk thousands of kilometer back home. Many workers have died due to lack of food, exhaustion, highway accidents while others have committed suicide on railway tracks due to lack of hope and help**. Several have been robbed by bus drivers because of their desperation to return home. The Indian government have tried to help, but this crisis has become a political game, which we can obviously see it happening in America as well. If you guyz have time, could you sign this petition located in the link below. Hopefully, we can together help them a little in our own way through this petition. Moreover, recently, Ivanka trump tweeted about, Jyoti, an Indian migrant worker’s daughter’s bravery who cycled thousands of kilometer home with her injured father in the back. While, celebrating her courage and bravery, I want to highlight the desperation of a daughter that has resulted due to this crisis. Please do sign the petition and feel free to share this with other people as well. Thank You.

"Yesterday was the 8 week mark since I really noticed symptoms and decided I needed to stay home, I had minor annoyance-level symptoms the prior Thursday.How I got it: I live in a very rural area of southern CO, US. The day I got sick, the confirmed case numbers for our whole valley (size of NJ, population ~45k) were at 5. One of those was a coworker who had stayed home sick the day after he had to talk to me about something (I'm in construction, this was a field guy and I'm an office guy). About 10 days later, I felt symptoms.The first three weeks were like the worst cold ever, but not as bad as the flu. Frequently I'd cough and have trouble regaining my breath afterwards, and had some bad fatigue, but that was it. At the end of that week, I went into the makeshift covid/respiratory clinic and got my test, a chest x-ray, an antibiotic (just in case), a steroid, and an inhaler. When I did get my positive confirmation, I was the 8th or 9th case in my county.About that time, the symptoms started getting much worse - still little to no fever the whole time, but breathing was much harder much more consistently, my SPO2 would drop down into the upper 80's from time to time, and I had ABSOLUTELY no energy to even pay attention to anything, let alone even sit up. The inhaler helped a lot. During those symptoms, I also started having issues where my heart was pumping very hard, and I'd be having simultaneous extra fatigue - to be safe, I started baby aspirin on the doc's suggestion. (had some blood draws during this and my clotting factors looked okay, though)Then I had two weeks where I was showing slow and not-quite-steady recovery. I could tell I was getting better overall, but each day wasn't necessarily better than the last. Still enough fatigue that I couldn't do much (there was one day I walked down the road, but I had to nap it off the rest of the day - previously I could barely make it across the house).Then suddenly, about a week ago I started having the feeling of something large I needed to cough out of my lungs, and a return to trouble breathing. Went back to the doc, and while one lobe sounded bad, the chest x-ray looked okay, but she started me on more antibiotics (standard issue when a viral disease in remission turns back suddenly), and a nebulizer. The latter didn't do nearly enough to make up for the side effects for me, but I'm glad to have it if I need it. Over the weekend I've developed much more typical symptoms - for the first time a real fever, that horrible, worst-of-my-life headache behind the eyes, continued trouble breathing/drowning in mucus but can't cough it out, body aches, etc. So, given that, I bet I have only another 1-2 weeks left before I'm better or need a ventilator. I am staying positive though.In contrast, my new wife (married 2/29/2020 - just in time!) has been taking no precautions around me at all, and has had what might be mild symptoms (or might be something else) for one day. She was never actually tested, but we've been assuming she's positive, and public health has told us that we'll both be out of isolation when I'm symptom-free for 72 hours. Also, as far as we're aware, nobody else from work has gotten sick (we both work at the same company in the office).I've had a county public health nurse calling me about every day to check on me (it's been slightly less, since they're more busy with a few outbreaks lately). And fortunately we have a great support system - I even had a very nice (but tiring) birthday last week (27) thanks to their help.Financially we're doing okay - fortunately we started in a good place, and since I'm salaried, I got three more weeks of sick pay (I was only owed two according to official policy). After that, we had the confirmation, so we were each able to get two full paid weeks of pay through CARES. We also both got the $1200 stimulus checks. However, since those two weeks ended, we have not been getting paid at all, and we're ineligible for unemployment since we can't work. This seems ass-backwards for me, and in a slightly different situation (like, say, me less than a year ago) would have meant horrible bankruptcy.Our work has been very helpful, and while I think they could have handled it a bit differently, it would literally have just affected us two. They've been operating fairly normally as an essential business this whole time, although some contracts have had issues (particularly school contracts), regarding funding and scheduling. I would be able to do most of my work from home, but I can't focus well enough to do anything. She can't really wfh at all.So yeah, I'm still sick, but not as bad as I have been and not nearly as bad as I could be. We know one other couple from church whose father died from it, and then they had a week each of mild symptoms, and one of my college friends (in Boston) had a confirmed case with mild symptoms for a week or two, but we know of no one else personally.Ask me anything or share your story! Personally, I find it very helpful to hear about other people's experiences!"
"I suppose this is more of a morality issue, but here it goes...My friend was diagnosed with Covid after feeling some 'odd' symptoms. Thankfully he hasn't gotten any of the serious respiratory effects and for the most part after his diagnosis it seems like he was toward the end of the virus as his symptoms improved. However, according to the CDC (and other health professionals) you should quarantine for a minimum of 2 weeks if you know you have it. Even though they say the whole 10 day thing, I would say to err on the side of caution it should be 14 at a minimum as we really don't know if we are still infectious after we feel better.Anyway, the day after he was diagnosed he goes out for a 7 mile bike ride in an urban area (we're not talking woods or trails here, i mean neighborhoods and streets).This really ticked me off. His excuse being that he felt ok and a friend apparently put it in his mind that he ""needs to keep his lungs open"".Correct me if I'm wrong but this last part seems absurd. I argued that if you're having trouble breathing and the virus has entered your upper respiratory tract then you may need to be on a ventilator to force oxygen, but 'going for a bike ride' to 'keep my lungs open' seems rather absurd and wouldn't force enough oxygen into your lungs anyway. Maybe I'm wrong, i don't know, just seems stupid. I further argued that if your body is trying to fight off a deadly infection that taxing it by doing strenuous exercise related activity probably isn't the best thing to do. I mean they don't say ""rest"" when you're sick for no reason.Additionally, I think this is a moral issue. I asked him if his neighbor had it, and you knew he had it and he was dicking around in his yard outside if he'd be pissed, to which he replied yes. I said if someone else had it and was riding his bike down your street with a sign that said ""I have Corona"" would you be pissed? He said yes. So he validates my points yet then continues to do what he wants.Morally I think this really is shitty of him to do. We have a civic duty to our fellow man to keep ourselves away from the general populous if we have it, regardless of our own half cocked theories and self treatment.Imagine if everyone who had it (and knew they did)  felt 'ok' and decided to venture out for non essential and basically recreational activities, we'd have a much larger caseload of people getting infected and greater loss of life. So I'm just curious everyone's thoughts on this.... Am I overreacting or is he being a selfish moron who is endangering people's lives?"
"This sucks. I’m sort of a anti social person in general, so when they locked everything down, I felt like I was living the dream: getting forced to stay home, still get paid for it, and play video games all day long. I’ve only left the house for groceries, sanitized and everything religiously. Fast forward to Tuesday, May 26th. At this point in time, only 9 reported cases. My dad messaged me asking to borrow money for groceries, I didn’t feel like going to the ATM so I said come get me and take me to the ATM.Me, my dad, and his girlfriend all go to the ATM, I give him the money, they take me home. Next day my mom calls me and says my dad’s girlfriend has been exposed, her mom has COVID-19. She’s been sick for 5 days.Like what the heck, they couldn’t have told me that? Haven’t talked to either of them since then, I’m just waiting to hear what they say about dad and his girlfriends test.I know I shouldn’t be mad, but I can’t help but feel pissed. You’d think that would be something you would tell somebody you’re about to meet. If ya’ll want. I’ll keep this updated and test results. It’s been 2 days since my exposure, don’t feel anything major. I already have major anxiety and I think I’m making myself think I’m getting sick at the moment. I feel fine, but when I start thinking about it, I suddenly feel like I can’t breathe.The moment my mom called and said that, I immediately felt “sick” if that makes sense. I don’t know, we’ll see."
"I live in Australia and I don’t understand what’s happening in USA. Can someone explain to me if there has been a lockdown? what is essential and non essential? And why they are reopening already? Like what is their reality at the moment? For us, restaurants and cafes are only open for take away so no sitting down. Hand sanitizer before you go into a shop with restrictions of how many people can go into a shop at any one time. 1.5 metres apart from people. And only essential workers are at work split up into teams so only a small amount of people are in the office. Like does the USA have stuff like that in place? I’m so shook over their stat’s."
"Long story; sorry but it’s important. I been in quarantine over a month because my father was feeling ill and I was just not wanting to get sick and pass it to others. Well eventually I started to feel ill. I started with a sore throat and then the next day I started to cough. I started to worry. I never cough even with a cold. But I was optimistic and thought maybe it’s just a bad cold or I could have the flu. Well the next day my dad got tested because he looked extremely ill and at this point I was not smelling or tasting food. And the next day we were told he was positive. So that same day I went and got tested along with my mother and the next day we were told we were positive. We followed the rules and stayed home.  We were going to return to work around the 20th of May because we all have essential jobs and that’s how long they gave us to stay in quarantine and I EXPECTED to be retested before returning to work to help stop the spread. They turned us away and said we have been tested already in the past and it was unnecessary and that we could return to work if we felt well enough. I was also told by DHEC that we didn’t have to prove we came out positive or negative for covid to our jobs. I was shocked. This meant people could lie and abuse the current situation to get out of work and be paid. Well my dad’s job would NOT let him return without retesting. So we had to trick the symptom checker from prisma health to get him retested and just 2 days ago we find out he was positive still! And then my mom and I did the same thing and found out today we are positive as well. We have no symptoms. And if we do, they can be confused with allergies. We know a woman who went thru the same thing and is still positive like us. We were going to work like that and just keep it spreading. So my point in this post, how do I get it to where it is MANDATORY to be retested before returning to work? Why is my state not allowing retests? Seems to me like they want it to spread."
"Day 68.5 - I scored us a free small fridge and toaster oven so we can now keep/reheat food! Tomorrow is my on call day, so I’ll spend it catching up on laundry, dishes, grocery shopping but my car is in the shop so i gotta take the bike, business paperwork, payroll, meal prepping, and giving verbal orders to the staff at work, calling in refills, and getting patient updates on the ones I’m following closely. But I’m starting it off with a little extra sleep-in, a morning run and workout, probably do some crest whitestrips (no time for a cleaning, lol), and a good home pedicure. THEN I’ll take care of all those other things. You have to take of YOU first sometimes, otherwise you’ll get burnt out and miserable. We’re putting in an absurd amount of human-hours doing hot, tiring, and extremely stressful work so that we can take care of the those who can’t take care of themselves. And filling in for the staff who have fallen ill and cannot work, or are high risk and on quarantine for their own safety, or who are too afraid of this scary new disease and what could happen if they got it. All the while hoping WE don’t get this weird damn disease that is not well understood yet. Missing our families. Eating, drinking, and peeing as quickly as we can so we don’t get too far behind in what has to be done. Stressing about passing meds on patients we don’t know yet. Hoping we don’t make any mistakes. Finding mistakes from others and trying to correct and educate. Answering call lights, doing post-mortem care. Starting IVs on frail, worn out bodies. Hoping for the best but knowing it’s not likely. Calling families. Referring to hospice. Running out of supplies; using a walking cane on a bedside table as an IV pole because there aren’t any more. Because this isn’t a hospital. It’s not an ICU. It’s a nursing home. Changing briefs, dressing stage IV pressure ulcers, apologizing for the pain it causes despite pre-medicating them for the procedure. Learning these people. Figuring out their nuances and how to get them to take their meds, just one bite of something, just a sip of water, please, you need it to get better. Signing updated DNRs. Wanting to do more. Always wanting to do more. I’m so unbelievably proud of my team. Thank you for what you do.I left this in a single paragraph because it just dumps the whole story on you this way. That is how ours days feel. It just doesn’t stop. Please be safe everyone. Wear your mask and wash your hands and don’t be an asshole. Our actions help determine who dies."
"I tried to post this on r/offmychest but it would not let me mention covid. I’m 16. To put it lightly I already had a tough year before the coronavirus was even a thing. My mother was diagnosed with cancer and were already not the best off with money so my anxiety started there. I have really really bad toxic friends in my life that haven’t even talked to me since the start of quarantine so I came here to get this ‘off my chest’. I am terrified, and no one is helping me cope. I’m in New Jersey so my state is still completely closed basically. It took me a while to get over the fact that there is a pandemic going on and now there are riots and I’m scared for people in them, and I’m scared for shop owners. I’m afraid things will never go back to “normal” after this pandemic. Will I get to grow up? Have a normal life? I think about it everyday and I tell myself this will pass but now I’m questioning it. My “friends” hang out everyday and post all over social media but I’m not invited and even if I was I couldn’t go I can’t risk my mother getting sick, and social distancing is still a thing I guess they don’t realize or care. So here I am stuck in my room ( I have been since March 13th) with no friends to talk to, and my thoughts. My anxieties. My one escape was going to be college, I can’t wait to get out of this town. Will I ever be able to now? It seems further away then ever. I’m just a kid, but the worst part is I’m not a young kid. I understand what’s happening, and I have to watch it happen and not just ignore it and play barbies like I could’ve done when I was 7, but I’m still a kid. I don’t think there is enough accessible support out there for teens like me who are scared out of their minds. I don’t know what to do anymore."
" **Cities across the nation are on fire even as COVID-19 has killed 102,000 Americans. Trump is desperate to shift blame. But scapegoating the WHO won't make things better.**"
"We use the regular blue thin face masks at my work, and with 14 facilities we are generating a lot of them. We are throwing them away but trying to think of ways to re purpose or recycle. Anyone out there have any ideas???"
"Guys, are these protests not going to spread COVID like wildfire in the states? No one seems concerned about this? Are the next 2 weeks going to absolutely overwhelm the American healthcare system? I get the protest is important ok, but there is an infectious disease out there spreading in these protests. Are Americans concerned, do they not care or do they not know?"
"I was talking to a good friend yesterday who told me this seems crazy to me, but true story. Here's the context:* My friend works at a non-profit that has the central mission of housing people of color and vulnerable populations (i.e. an essential service)* Most of their work is and was done on a computer. Two things they typically work on in-person are facility visits which typically happened monthly (pre-SIP) and signing documents. (This friend went into the office on weekends to sign paperwork regularly during SIP, while people were gone).* This is in California.Here's the story:*In April, staff at their agency began requesting shelter in place (SIP), which was granted on a case-by-case basis. They were approved to SIP for the duration of the state requirements both verbally and in writing.  They continued to work, get paid, attend meetings, etc - mostly from home.**Upon returning to work on Monday, June 1, at the beginning of California's re-opening, they were told by their boss that they had demonstrated a ""lack of leadership by sheltering in place"" - clearly and point-blank. And therefore, they would be demoted, with less pay and a lesser title.***Is this legal? Ethical? Seem weird? What should this person do?** I would love to hear some thoughts and other perspectives."
"I saw this article in the Atlantic today (https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/612679/) about people who have had covid who are experiencing debilitating symptoms months later. I tested negative for covid three months after I experienced the worst pneumonia of my life. It felt like acute silicosis. I believe I had covid and am hoping to get an antibody test, but I work in homeless services and the timeline for the sickness fits with covid so I cant prove I had it and am uncounted in the statistics, technically just a negative test.I went from being a very athletic 30 year old, run 7 miles after work, lift and swim etc, to basically a complete loaf. I feel like I've been tired for the past four months since symptoms started. I'm finally starting to get better, but as the article describes, I feel like I fall into an uncounted box. I feel like my body is radically weaker and more susceptible to illness.I wanted to reach out and see if other people have had similar experiences. It makes me so frustrated when people minimize covid because I feel like its dangers are much more nuanced than we understand."

" Hi everyone. My soon-to-be MIL lives in Russia and has a one year visit to visit the US, where her sons live. This is really special because she got the visa after being rejected and unable to visit her sons for years and years. She was supposed to come see us this summer.What I need to figure out is how safe it would be for her to fly with an n100 mask. If all particles are filtered out during her flight would that be okay? She could stay pretty isolated once she arrives. But we are worried because she is 62 years old. Also, what is the chance that an n100, that was purchased approx. 14 years ago would fail?If someone could point me in the right direction for how to navigate this, that would be great. Thank you."
"I'm from Australia but currently live in the UK. Obviously both countries have tackled covid in very different ways, with the UK having a high rate of infections and not closing borders while aus closed borders and has had very little infections. I know it's complicated, but generally speaking am I right in saying that what tactic ultimately looks the best depends on if we find a vaccine or not? I'd like to go back to aus to see my family, but I can't imagine them opening borders till a vaccine is found as they have no herd immunity. So if none is found, what happens then? Aus can't stay isolated forever and in that situation will countries like the UK who look pretty bad right now actually ironically be in a better position? Thanks!"

"During a zoom happyhour with some friends, we discussed what COVID would do to change society etc.Here is what we came up with:1. Location flexibility for work and school will allow people to live more where they want, as long as they do not have a physical component to work.2. Location flexibility will lead to time flexibility, with things like recorded classes, AI chatbots, 24hr call centers and other services allowing for better scheduling for people.3. Travel will become special again, but be a little different. If you don't physically have to be at work or school, you don't need to wait for holidays to go, and you can go for much longer periods instead of multiple short trips.4. Business travel is dumb. So are conferences, these are probably going to shrink a lot.5. All services that do not require a physical outcome, will move online. No more standing in line for a document at the government office, you can get things notarized digitally, etc.6. Disinfecting stuff is a pain in the ass. Wiping things down is time consuming and a waste of chemicals.  Instead, we will all probably end up getting a UV light box about the size of a large suitcase to toss things in for 30 seconds. This may get incorporated into things like the slot you pass cash, credit cards, keys, tickets, etc. at the shop as well.7. PPE sucks in general. For people that stay in one place (Hotel desk, etc.) we may see either video screens, or the return of the glassed-in booth. Long term, we may go back to not needing masks etc, but some segment of the population will keep it up long term. Biggest problems are- hard to breathe, can't hear what people are saying, can't see faces.  Face shields are a nice option overall, but are not ideal. As disturbing as it sounds, some sort of bubble helmet may be the solution, with filters in the back and maybe a mic/speaker combo for communications. But somehow I doubt we will all be astronauts.8. Vulnerable people: I don't want to seal grandma into a terrarium, but there isn't much that pops up as a great idea for these people until a vaccine is available.9. Gender roles: Well, if everyone is home, then the duties of running the house kinda have to be shared with all the residents. This shift has been underway for a long time already, but it will need to accelerate. Especially if time shifting means that people can pause what they are doing to go help with the kids or make dinner etc.10. Public space: Not many people have everything in their homes that they need. If you are in a small apartment then you don't have access to a lot of things, especially outdoor space. We will probably see the privatization of public space in some ways (booking a time slot at a pool, or an area at the beach, etc.) but the worry is that if you are reserving private access to public spaces, then it will become monetized and will unfairly impact the poor. Not sure how to solve that, but the idea of paying to sit on a park bench and read the paper does not seem right.11. Dating is going to be interesting. Probably will be a while before you sleep with someone who's name you can barely remember. That is unless full-body condoms become a thing.12. Participation in government is going to increase. You can't keep denying people from being heard by restricting the right to vote to a physical location (see point 5). Mail or digital means will free this up, and people might actually get to be heard. This has upsides and downsides, in that if it is too easy, then you will get stupid outcomes like ""Boaty McBoatface"" as a write-in candidate in the lead. On the other hand, after a couple rounds of this nonsense people might realize that there is an actual value to their voice and start taking it seriously.As I said, this was just a bunch of spitballing by some middle-aged people from all walks of life, professions, and nationalities.Did we get it horribly wrong, or is there something we missed? Comments welcome!"
A person in my house INSISTS on having their friend come stay with us for a month. We are in PA and the friend is flying from California and has been in and out of both LAX and the Chicago airport. I pleaded with my roommate to wait a little longer before inviting them but they insist now is a great time. I'm very worried that this friend will be introducing the virus into our home and completely ruining what we have been self isolation for for months. Is there any precautions I can take to ensure this person doesn't spread the virus around my house? Should they take a shower when they arrive? Should i spray them with lysol? I don't want to freak out but I'm also very uncomfortable and nervous by this. Am I too worried? Just wanted to know if anyone had any helpful tips or advise on what i can do to protect myself and other if this person has been exposed without knowing.

"Vigilance and nimbleness over coronavirus outbreaks are critical in restarting economies.Excerpt from article [A warning from South Korea: the ‘fantasy’ of returning to normal life] (https://www.ft.com/content/d68d6292-0486-4bfc-bf5c-54ce850a3f7a)""Jerome Kim, an immunology expert and director-general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, says governments will need to have clear plans and thresholds for reinstating tougher measures, including more localised and targeted lockdowns, as well as find ways to keep the public aware of the risks. “The real key is — why aren’t we getting the message across about the need to protect people?” he says.  Dr Kim also warns, however, that while the lockdowns were in one sense necessary for “flattening the curve” of infection rates, they should have also been used to give public health authorities “breathing room” to ensure adequate tracing, testing and protective equipment resources were all in place.  “In countries where that wasn’t necessarily done correctly, they do run the potential risk of large and uncontrolled outbreaks.”"
"We are just in the beginning of the destruction of COVID19. If we thought we were getting out of the worst of it, I've got some bad news.All time high record COVID19 cases were set today in:  1. TEXAS (+57% vs. previous all time high) 2. OKLAHOMA (+57%; 425% increase since June 1)3. ARIZONA (+54%)4. FLORIDA (+48%; +387% increase since June 1) 5. MISSOURI (+53%)6. S.

Thus, with exponential curves like this, countries that 'beat' the virus early on like Taiwan, China, S. Korea, Germany, N.

It is unlikely that testing is increasing exponentially evenly across all these states - you'd see 'spikes' in active cases when test kits are shipped in, yet we see organic growth curves. Either way, no matter the data source, it is showing that the virus is spreading rapidly)."
"As many may know, Texas cases have been going up quite a bit this past week. This is thanks to our governor. My Democratic county judge, however, finally convinced our governor to require face masks in businesses. However, I don’t know that it will be enough to decrease cases. Please share some research on this, and thanks in advance."
"I went to the BMV today and I took a driving test. I needed a license for college in the fall and my test was canceled in March and so I had to get in to make up test. I passed the test and had my parent wait in the line. The line was not 6 feet apart, nor were the lines that they had us stand in inside the building. Other than staff, my parent and I and 3 other people were wearing masks, that was it the whole 3 hours I was there. The line was out the door and around the building the entire time that I was there...no one else was wearing a mask, or socially distancing.I know wearing masks is not what people want, but I stood in 100 degree heat in a mask to protect the people there from me spreading the virus (if I am asymptomatic, but I have not left the house for awhile, but just out of respect for the people there), yet, I am immunocompromised and should not even be in a mask with my severe heat induced asthma and other medical autoimmune conditions, but I did it anyway. Please consider those who are immunocompromised and wear a mask and socially distance when you are out in a more crowded public space...We are no safer than we were in March, we are now just fatigued of fighting this virus and we cannot let up, because letting up is what will get people killed and what has been getting people killed.Wearing a mask is not a matter of politics, it is a matter of standing together and working towards a common goal, to stop the spread of the virus and it is a shame that it has been made political.Thank you for listening to me rant a little bit, mask wearing has been on my mind a lot lately, but this really raised my concern.I have attached an article from WHO on when and how to wear face masks in public if you are not sure of the proper etiquette.[Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public: When and how to use masks](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/when-and-how-to-use-masks)"
All I’m seeing is people acting like there isn’t a pandemic. I don’t want more people to die or get sick. Why don’t people care? Where I live I’m always one of the few people wearing a mask social distancing.
"Hi, I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub, but I guess I just need some advice. I'm a 23 year old woman and I haven't worked since late March. I was laid off from work, and had the opportunity to come back at the beginning of June, but decided to take a leave of absence. I am extremely anxious about going back to work, and I'm not even sure if I want to. I work in a salon setting, checking in/out clients face to face. I guess I'm just looking to see what the likelihood of me catching COVID are if I wear a mask when talking to clients, and sanitizing my hands in-between. I realize that things need to go back to normal at some point, and that staying at home all the time might not be best for my immune system, but sometimes I feel like I can't even go to the grocery store without having anxiety. I'm especially worried for the next cold/flu season. Sorry if this is all over the place, I have a hard time laying my thoughts out in text."
"I am a young woman in my twenties, and I had COVID-19 in early March of this year. I had symptoms for several days, but it was overall a mild case. The last symptoms I acquired were loss of taste and smell. Eventually, those came back and everything appeared to be back to normal, at least for a few weeks. I also tested positive for antibodies in May. Beginning in April, I started to notice that certain things I used to eat and enjoy now had a very unpleasant taste and smell to them. This started with processed sliced bread and goldfish crackers. I couldn’t even eat them, the taste was so off-putting. I thought it might be related to gluten or preservatives/artificial ingredients of some kind, but assumed it would return to normal eventually. It seems as though now this off-putting taste and smell is spreading into more and more foods as time goes on. All types of chips are now off-putting—Cheez It’s, Sun Chips, Whole Foods potato chips, corn chips—as well as the inside of Reese’s peanut butter cups and all-natural peanut butter, ice cream cones, and anything that’s been deep-fried. I ate these things after recovering from COVID-19 with no issues, but now they are basically inedible. It isn’t all gluten, because pasta is totally fine, as are most baked goods. Taylor Ham and kielbasa also have the same issue. It could be something to do with oil content, as that seems to possibly be a common thread. All of these foods I’ve mentioned have the same bad taste and smell—it’s not just that foods taste slightly different than normal; there is a new, gross smell and taste that wasn’t there before. I experience the taste and smell to varied extremes. Some foods have the slightly-off smell but taste alright, some are worse, and others I can’t even force myself to eat because it’s so strong. Has anyone else experienced this after recovering from COVID-19? Will my sense of taste and smell ever return to normal? Help!"
"It is hard to find a personal account of what someone is experiencing when they have COVID. I went to all the COVID reddits and they were plentiful in knowledge and news regarding covid, but offered no avail on how people are dealing with the sickness. All the major covid communities, and everything that pops up seem to be statistics and news. (This would be really awesome in other scenarios, but it alienates people who are sick and they might not be able to see something that helps them.) I understand the importance of factual information, and that misinformation can and is spreading easily in the anxiety ridden world of covid. This is what helped me, and I understand others might have had different or worse symptoms. I called multiple nurses and hospitals in my confused and tired panic. They offered some help, but overall kind of just told me what I already knew. (Tea, rest, water, gargle salt water for throat) To someone who feels like they're dying this was kind of unhelpful, but talking with them helped alleviate stress and anxiety. (I dont mean to discredit Healthcare officials in any way shape or form, and i understand that this virus is unpredictable and unknown) Today I was tested and i should know in a couple days whether or not I have it. I match a lot of the symptoms, but I will go more in depth on how exactly I feel. My head feels congested like when youre sick and have mucus in your head. I feel intoxicated and dyslexic and it takes longer for me to understand or remember things. My nose is dry, which makes it harder to breathe and smell. My throat hurts and feels tight, and I cannot breathe in deep. Do not panic unless you are wheezing or lose breath doing simple tasks. That might be a sign of pneumonia, or hypoxia. I initially thought I had hypoxia because of my confusion and headaches. I panicked that my blood wasn't getting sufficient oxygen so I looked up ways to expand my airways so that i could hopefully oxygenate my blood. Sleeping in an upright position with pillows lifting my knees up helped, but I'm not sure if it's the most optimal position. I had also raised one of my arms up, but be careful to massage or do something to promote circulation (in all appendages). If it was still difficult to breathe i would then lay on my stomach with my elbows buried, slightly raising me up (kind of like a plank, but I would lay over or on my pillow). If youre on your back all day it can clog the back of your lungs essentially and by flipping it around you can expose the parts of your lungs that might be stuffed with fluid or such (this is paraphrasing and moreso how it feels, i visited pneumonia websites because I had fear that i developed it, and this was one of the tips. There isn't fluid in your lungs until you develop pneumonia,  but the tightness makes your lungs feel like there is)Anxiety is honestly one of the worst parts of the virus. Being anxious causes your heart to beat faster making it even harder to breathe. For me a lot of audio visual stuff was giving me anxiety, I normally listen to hip hop and rap but it was too much for my head, and when I tried distracting myself with movies and shows I couldn't watch action. I end up watching, or listening rather, to a kids show as i daze off into rest. I believe that eating antioxidants and NOT eating sugars will also help you deal with the breathing issues. Sugar makes your heart beat fast, i learned this the hard way when i was solely eating fruit. (Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Strawberry, Grape) Water also helps a lot. Seriously, drink as much water as you can. Even if you don't feel like you can.Rest plays a big role, the more you rest the slower your heart is beating and you're allowing your body to fight the virus. If you feel like you can't breathe, even by manually doing it, and you arent wheezing then you're still relatively okay. I know it is miserable, but you must try your best to control your anxiety and not panic in this scenario. I found it best to inhale through my mouth and slowly exhale through my nose. I would only do this 3 or so times, because I had a fear that I would pass out. I'm not sure if that is the case, but you can determine that for yourself. REMEMBER you are not alone and that this battle is both physical and mental. Keeping your mind distracted helps deal with the anxiety. For me I always look at the wrong and I worry about the bad, and this was counterintuitive at first. A thought that helped me power on was ""this is the worst of it, this is the peak, tomorrow it gets better."" I am not a doctor. I researched in my panic attacks and wish I would have saved the sources to all of the websites I visited, or at least remembered them. (i didn't intend on sharing my experience) Please pardon any mess ups I made while typing this, i am usually pretty good at English and shit but my head feel dummy boy rn. I also get that some of this might be hard to read, might be overly convulated, or not in the right order.Edit: Just found this subreddit that has a lot of helpful stuff to deal with anxiety and stresshttps://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fynuak/keeping_busy_during_covid19_megathread/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share"

My question for y’all is should I stop smoking weed while I have covid-19? Results came back positive yesterday. Been experiencing mild symptoms for about 4-5 days and so far smoking hasn’t impacted the way I feel except for at night. My shortness of breath gets a little worse and I focus on breathing too much and get anxiety. Should i stop smoking entirely while infected? Cut back more? Or just not smoke at night so I’m not paranoid about my breathing? I know smoke is irritating the lungs but don’t come at me with all the “pots bad for you” “addictive” “carcinogenic” bull crap.
"I finally had the opportunity to get out of my office today and realized this isn't ending anytime soon.  I was at Ralph's market (a large supermarket chain) and saw, mostly older shoppers, not wearing masks.  There were also a number of employees flashing nostrils.When I got home I decided to take a walk down Ventura Boulevard.  A restaurant, Bluebird Brasserie, has taken over the sidewalk, leaving only a narrow path to walk through with people eating on both sides (no masks, of course).  There were wait staff on both sides, one with a mask but no face shield, the other with a face shield but no mask; both are required in the City of Los Angeles.Get ready for round 2."
NIANTIC SHOULD RELEASE POKEMON GO 2!
" Reposting from a COVID ICU nurse :Here you go folks... for those people who don't understand what it means to be on a ventilator but want to take the chance of going out without a mask...  For starters, it's NOT an oxygen mask put over the mouth while the patient is comfortably lying down and reading magazines. Ventilation for Covid-19 is a painful intubation that goes down your throat and stays there until you live or you die.  It is done under anesthesia for 2 to 3 weeks without moving, often upside down, with a tube inserted from the mouth up to the trachea and allows you to breathe to the rhythm of the lung machine. The patient can't talk or eat, or do anything naturally - the machine keeps you alive.  The discomfort and pain they feel from this means medical experts have to administer sedatives and painkillers to ensure tube tolerance for as long as the machine is needed. It's like being in an artificial coma.  After 20 days from this treatment, a young patient loses 40% muscle mass, and gets mouth or vocal cords trauma, as well as possible pulmonary or heart complications.  It is for this reason that old or already weak people can't withstand the treatment and die. Many of us are in this boat ... so stay safe unless you want to take the chance of ending up here. This is NOT the flu.  Add a tube into your stomach, either through your nose or skin for liquid food, a sticky bag around your butt to collect the diarrhea, a foley catheter to collect urine, an IV for fluids and meds, an A-line f to monitor your BP that is completely dependent upon finely calculated med doses, teams of nurses, CRNA’s and MA’s to reposition your limbs every two hours and lying on a mat that circulates ice cold fluid to help bring down your 104 degree temp.  \-Anyone want to try all that out? Stay home and wear a mask when you go out! Stay safe and well!-  What this article doesn't say, is that the patient can hear everything that is said so if the staff carelessly talks about death, the patient panics. If the sedatives are lessened, the patient panics because he can't breath or talk or, in his case, move. When they begin to lower the pain medications, the patient screams in his head but can't make a sound. When they take out the tubes it's extremely uncomfortable. A trachea may replace the respirator, the patient still can't talk or eat without a tube.  Your child, your spouse, your parent, suffers from covid 19 alone in the hospital. The victims are not limited to strangers. When you choose to crowd, unmasked, into newly opened stores for some irrelevant purchase, ask yourself if it's worth a lifetime of knowing your child suffered, maybe died, alone. Comments from my friend:This is the shape my momma died in.   I wouldn't wish this on anyone, especially not my momma.   Words can not describe the helplessness you feel, as you depend on strangers to tell you anything about your mom's condition.   Bless them for always being so kind and falsely optimistic.  They knew what we didn't want to hear.  I have cursed myself numerous times over the past month for taking her to the hospital that Sunday.  Yes, I blame myself for urging her to go to the hospital at all.  Had I known the ending, I'm not sure I would have.   I kept telling myself, she just needs more oxygen, some meds to help. She will be back home in a couple of days and we will laugh about how she talked out of her head, how she didn't know who I was, she wouldn't believe she refused to open her mouth for the thermometer and she would be mad that I brought her to the hospital with her hair uncombed and her toenail polish chipped.  She will come back home.  As the 3 nurses got her from the car, she grimaced and moaned because her back was hurting, maybe more was hurting I don't know.   I remember the look on her face.  Her nose scrunched up, her eyes were tightly shut as she winced.   I started crying because I knew she was in pain, not bc that was the last time I saw my sweet momma.   I whispered I love you and ill be here when you come home.  The nurse reassured me they would take good care of her.  I knew they would, but its My Momma.  I need to be holding her hand, as I had the whole ride there.  The tv reports don't tell you this side of COVID.  They tell you numbers that rise daily.   They don't tell you how it feels to drive away, leaving your momma.  They don't tell you all the questions you ask of the medical staff or yourself as you wait on the outside.  They don't tell you the pain you feel just not being there.   They don't tell you what words to say to your dying momma when the sweet social worker, suited up, holds a cell phone to her ear for you to say goodbye.  They don't tell you how hard it is to say turn the machine and meds off, how defeated and sad and mad and heartbroken you are.  They don't tell you how to hug your daddy as he sobs for his wife of 54 years who was ""just"" sick.  If they did, I hope you would take it all more serious.   Stay home, if you go out wear a mask or keep your distance."
So since this pandemic has hit I’ve be very hateful and stuff and my mood is not very good is that normal
"I live in Dallas County. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins has been trying for so long to bring down cases. Cases have multiplied fivefold thanks to idiots not giving a crap for other people. People are turning it political. Governor Abbott only just now started rolling back restrictions thank God. Can’t decide whether to be mad that he didn’t do it sooner or thankful that he did it now. I’m hoping that restriction roll backs will cause cases to decrease. But man, I’ve never been more thankful for a politician than I have for Clay Jenkins. I very much wish he could do more.Think about how you’ll turn out in the history books. Do you want to tell your children/grandchildren that you were one of the people who made mask wearing political? Or do you want to tell them with integrity and pride that you cared for others in the midst of this crisis. That you held your ground despite what was going on in your life. Instead of going after herd immunity just because you want it to end. I have my senior year of high school to look forward to. I’ve had it for a while. Don’t know how it will turn out now. But I swear to God I’ll hold out to the end for those who need it most.And to the Christian community. This is what it’s about. Not shaming others for being “afraid” or whatnot. You can’t tell me Christ wasn’t afraid when He cried blood at the Garden of Gethsemane. Or when He begged to God for there to be another solution. But I’m not doing this out of fear. I’m doing it out of love. That’s what it’s always been about. Or did you forget? It’s not about refusing to wear a mask because you want to not be “one of those pussy liberals who tries to spread fear.” It’s about doing something simple even if there’s a 1% chance it will work. Even if you’ll only give one person a bit more comfort being around you. Or if there’s only a small chance you have COVID. So wear a friggin mask."
I warned an elderly man at my job that there was someone who just got sent home because they tested positive for antibodies at work. They were working at the store while they were sick. So that means chances are the virus is lurking some where over there. I warned a 90 year old man that he should be more careful because there's an even more elevated risk for him now. I got fired for that. For warning an at risk person that the potential for transmission was elevated. Why do we have to be like this? Now I'm unemployed in the worst state to be unemployed in.
"Hi! I work at an apartment complex for students and starting August we will be entering around 300 apartments continuously for 2 weeks in order to get them ready for incoming students. However any people that renewed will still be in some bedrooms. I asked my managers what precautions we are taking and all I really get back is “we will be wearing masks.” I don’t feel like this is enough though... we will be moving furniture, repainting walls, fixing appliances and much more. We are on a strict schedule to finish in time since we cannot push back the move in date. However, I fear that if one person gets it we will all have to stop and get tested which means no one moves in on the move-in date. I feel that we are putting ourselves and the students that renewed their lease and are staying in the units in danger as well. I have many concerns...I am also frustrated because our amenities are still open, we have not sent out any safety regulations and cases are rising tremendously in the area. Am I over reacting or is this as bad as I think it seems? Advice?"
"I’ve tried holding back my stances on Covid-19 and masks for awhile. I’ve taken the time to read what a lot of you are saying and your stances. I’ve commented on a lot of what you are all saying and thinking.I’ve thought long and hard, and now, I think it’s time I share my story with you all. On March 15th I went into urgent care struggling to breathe, coughing up thick phlegm, massive headache, and a cough. As soon as I arrived, my vitals and oxygen levels were tested. My oxygen was at 79 (I was told 90 usually gets you admitted). They tested me for flu and strep before I could even be seen by a doctor. Upon negative strep and flu tests, a doctor came and advised due to the amount of tests available, I wouldn’t be tested for Covid. After listening to my lungs, and taking a chest X-ray, they determined I should be treated for Covid. I was given a nebulizer in house, steroids, inhalers, and a severe nasal spray, cough suppressants, then sent home once my oxygen levels reached 90. 2 weeks later, I woke up around 1am, struggling to breathe. I couldn’t walk down the stairs and yelling for my fiancé in the basement wasn’t possible due to my lack of oxygen. I used both of my emergency inhalers, and my nasal spray. Nothing worked. My fiancé (Ryne) rushed me to the ER. When I arrived my oxygen was at 68. As soon as I was in the room, I was met with multiple doctors in full on body covering. They administered oxygen right away, steroids via IV, an EKG, chest X-rays, and a Covid test within the first 20 minutes. It was intense. And I was petrified. I had to alert all of my family and friends I’d been around. I had to tell them I potentially exposed them to something awful. This broke me. If you’ve never experienced guilt, try telling someone with COPD you might have exposed them to a fatal pandemic for someone in her shoes. I found out that the reason covid isn’t like the flu is because it affects your heart and the chest X-ray because it leaves lasting damage on your lungs. Prior to having a positive Covid test, I’d never had any symptoms of asthma. After Covid, I’ve been diagnosed with asthma. My doctors have all advised that they don’t know if this is a lasting affect of Covid or not. Since I was diagnosed, it’s been 3 months and I am finally healthy. I can ride my new bike, walk up my stairs, clean my house, walk my dogs around the block. The most tragic part of this whole entire thing for me was saying goodbye to my fiancé and dogs. I know that sounds dramatic, and really out there, but when you wake up and you cannot breathe and nothing is working...you think this is it. The most tragic part was saying goodbye to the people I hold the most dear. Not knowing if I would see them in 1 day, 14 days, or if this would be the last glimpse I get at what I love so much. While in the hospital I learned that if one person who is infected wears a mask, it decreases your rate of getting it by 70%. If you are wearing a mask and happen to come into contact with someone who is +, but also wearing a mask, your risk is 1.5%. As someone who is still dealing with the consequences of not being responsible. As someone who hopes that you never have to wonder when you’ll see your loved ones, die alone, or attend a funeral via zoom... I urge you all to wear your masks and follow the social distancing guidelines. If not for you, for those that would miss you so much. 💜*after people have asked, please feel free to share *"
"I understand and respect the seriousness of the current pandemic situation, but something has bothered me for weeks now. I'm sick and TIRED of listening to people whine about wearing a mask for 45 minutes while they shop for groceries or go out to eat. I'm not a nurse, I'm a pharmacy technician, and I want to make that abundantly clear. The wonderful nurses who are on the frontlines of this situation everyday deserve the utmost respect and admiration. But I digress, nonetheless, I have to wear a mask for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. If I can do it, you can do it. Grow up. Shut up. Do what's right. If you don't like it, tough. Than you all for reading this and I hope you all have a wonderful day."
"My(24) son is 6 years old. He tested positive for COVID. He is completely fine. No symptoms, never would’ve known he had it. We tested because a teacher at his daycare tested positive and I am a social worker who works with clients who have HIV. So of course we took extra precautions and quarantined. Well to our surprise he tested positive and I’m negative.I’m a single mom. My mom is older and has copd. I have a sister and friend who are willing to help if I get very sick and need help with him. So has there been any parents with a child this young that had it and either ended up getting it to? Or didn’t end up with it? I can’t quarantine from him, he’s 6. He’s also not sick so he’s been running around playing. Me on the other hand, starting to feel not so great."
"Title. 6 of my wife's coworkers who she sees often (social distancing be damned) now want to have a large barbeque with the familes. We're talking 25-30 people. They did this last month and I thought it was a bad idea, so I didn't attend and clearly i am the only one who thought that way.Now again they're planning a barbeque for this weekend."
"At the beginning of the year, I woke up with a bad stomach bug right after New Year’s Day. The next week, I had a week-long panic attack due to my lilapsophobia. I went back to school the next week genuinely asking people if they thought 2020 was cursed. They laughed and shrugged. Thought I was being silly. Turns out I was right. Things only got worse from there. 2020 has been a crappy year. But this last six months has shown me that 2020 wasn’t cursed by God, but by us. We have made our own situation worse than it already was. This half-year has been an example of the imperfection and needfulness of humanity. Exactly six months from the beginning of the year, I ask people to make a change. Make this next half-year an example of human ingenuity and ability to help those who need it most when they need it most. Wear a mask and social distance. Ask people what they need most. Regardless of religion, race, or political stance."
"Those of you who think wearing a mask is infringing on your rights and liberties as an American. Need to close Facebook and open a real book. One of the government's main jobs is to keep American people's rights and liberty's safe. As an American you have rights. You have the right to Life (health), liberty and the pursuit of happiness. You do have the right to not wear the mask. If you CHOOSE not to ware it and go out, you're infringing on others rights to LIFE (Health), LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness. Not wearing the mask is oppressing the people who take other American lives (health), liberty, freedoms, and civic responsibility seriously. The mask is not oppressing you it's giving you freedom, It's giving you the freedom and the liberty to do as you want without harming others. Keep not wearing mask's, and they'll take are liberties away.  Good luck out there covidiots."
"There are a number of reasons that people aren’t wearing masks en masse in America, but I think a major one has to do with the fact that we told people the masks aren’t necessary to keep you safe, but to protect others. We are an incredibly selfish, entitled nation and Covid has only shone an even brighter light on that fact. The president and his rhetoric are by no means blameless in our refusal to collectively wear masks, but a large burden falls on the shoulders of American citizens. Once people found out that not wearing a mask wouldn’t affect them but others, a depressingly large percentage of our population said fuck it, I’ll do me. Of all the lies, deceit and misinformation that has been spread over the past few months, we really would have benefited from the experts telling us that masks protect the wearers. Maybe people would give a little more of a shit.I should point out that I am in no way blaming experts here. I have nothing but the utmost respect and confidence in the medical experts. I’m simply saying that if there was one thing we SHOULD have hid it’s the aforementioned comment."
I already tested neg last week but some new symptoms -severely reduced sense of taste -no fever (97.4F)-yesterday had a real bad headache and it felt like a head stroke/hangover. Took a nap and woke up drenched in sweat. -nasal congestion Getting a new test tomorrow but it’s really weird and outta the blue. What do y’all think?
"Hi guys, I live in a country which has 500-600 news cases per day. Our health system has collapsed; when people call Ambulance, they wait for an hour or smth on the line and it takes ambulance 1-2 days to arrive. Right now, as far as I know, there is no vacant hospital bed for covid-19 patient, so they would take you to the hospital only if you’re about to die...And most of medical workers don’t want to deal with covid-19 patients. People in my country are so ignorant, there is still significant portion of the population that thinks that this is all hoax: some people don’t believe in the virus at all, the rest doesn’t take it serious. Every time when I go for groceries I see people not wearing any masks, not keeping any distance...I’m feeling scared every day and part of my fear comes from stupid unreliable healthcare system in my country.Therefore, I’m trying to plan ahead, to think what should I do in case, God forbid, this happens to me or my loved one? Which medications I should have? How do you treat this at home? Keep in mind that pharmacies in my country ran out of most commonly used medications and supplements (like Zinc, vitamin C, Azithromycin and etc). Right now, I have vitamin C, vitamin D, paracetamol, ibuprofen and nimesulide and a little bit of Azithromycin."
"So I work at a taco bell, and lately they've been making everyone work even while showing symptoms of covid 19, I worked with two people that tested positive, I went and got tested and came out negative just to find out I worked with someone else that tested positive, and on top of that, that person had been making food for customers for two weeks with heavy symptoms. They're making peoe work regardless of symptoms, and not giving anyone time to get tested. Something has to be done"
"I went into a store today called ""The Market Place"" at Roxbury.  It is in Roxbury, NJ.  I went to the meat &amp; fish counter and most of the people behind the counter were not wearing masks.  One person prepared sushi grade tuna without a mask.  I asked him why they weren't wearing masks and they said, ""We have medical conditions that we can't wear a mask and that condition cannot be disclosed due to HIPAA.""  Sure enough there was a sign basically stating that employees were exempt.  I didn't buy it for one second.  I gave the sushi back and told them I wasn't comfortable eating sushi from a place where nobody is taking COVID precautions.  To me, that translates to, ""I don't want to be mildly inconvenienced by a mask so I make up a fake medical condition so I don't have to follow the rules that everyone else does.""  They are likely trying to make a political statement at the expense of everyone who shops at the store.  I didn't think you could violate executive order via ridiculous loopholes like that.I am never shopping at that store again.  I reported them to NJ COVID violation board.  I get not wearing a mask if you are working in other areas, but food prep is a big no no and that just shows these people are too selfish to be alive.  And if anybody has a respiratory condition so bad that they can't even wear a mask, then COVID is LETHAL to them, so they shouldn't be working in customer service. The whole thing is complete BS."
"Should I get tested for COVID again? I got tested a couple weeks ago when I just had a cough, and body aches; it was negative. So I figured it was just my allergies acting up. Now I have a cough, body aches, and sore throat. No fever as of yet. It might just be a cold, but should I get tested again? I do work delivery, but I wear a mask, social distance when possible, and sanitize and wear gloves when delivering when possible. I can't stop working until I know. I just can't afford it. I heard sometimes it's just a false negative because the virus hasn't built up enough in the system. Any help appreciated."
"My husband works at a hospital which has an attached rehab center. He was sent to the rehab to fill in for some folks that called out. Couple days later was notified that a patient there tested positive for COVID. As the team is tracking down how the patient got COVID (in a highly regulated hospital with all proper precautions) they find out patient's daughter lied on her COVID form in order to visit her dad at rehab. The dad was non-critical. He was at the rehab doing PT after a standard hip surgery. Now - 3 nurses have tested positive for COVID. The patient has COVID AND the daughter is currently in the ICU due to COVID. Again, please do not lie to a hospital about your history, temp checks, etc. You are putting entire hospital departments at risk."
"So here's the story: A friend of mine works at a bar owned by one of her best friends. He tested positive for Covid and told all the other employees except for my friend and one other employees and instructed everyone explicitly to not tell them about it. They then told regular patrons that the owner has covid and has been routinely going into the bar while being positive, so they can know to stay away and get tested. The owner then found out that the patrons were warned and got mad at them for telling people to not come into the bar. Is there any way to report this person for knowingly spreading this disease? Sorry if this isnt the right place to ask I'm just not sure if anything can be done because he's putting so many people at risk and doesn't see that he's in the wrong."
so when quatatine started my family stopped talking to each other and me(14 male)  and my step brother (18) don't talk anyways he go out a lot and my step dad didn't tell him anything he would go to everyday since my family kinda got torn apart and he brung home covid because he wasn't wearing a mask and got positive and then he may have got my step dad sick and idk what to do I'm  just scared that my step dad is gonna die because of my step brother selfishness I didn't want to tell my mom because she's next to my step dad and I basically isolated my self from family physically but idk if that's enough
"I need some advice. As of right now my college is supposed to start back mid August with online, hybrid, and face to face classes. I have an apartment at college that I will be moving into with a roommate, we will both be moving in at the same time. I don’t know what kind of precautions I need to take when moving in together and how to be safe while having been in different situations for months. Do we need to wear masks when we’re in the same room of the apartment? What do I do if she doesn’t want to wear masks or wants to have people over often? It is very important to me that I avoid getting covid as I do not want to risk putting my family in danger (they are older) and I also am very concerned about the long term effects of the virus. Any and all advice is extremely helpful."
What do you do when you have underlying health conditions and your spouse refuses to social distance or wear a mask when out in public close to others? This is a really difficult topic for me and I am at my wits end trying to convince her to at least have respect for my health...even if she doesn’t care about hers.
"Hi guys I need some advice. I’m a mental health counselor and my job requires me to go into homes to provide services. Well, one of my families did not follow protocol and proceeded to celebrate this weekend by going to a party. It turns out a family member (sibling) who was the party is now experiencing symptoms a few days after the party leaving the family exposed. Since I was at the house for over 2 hours my supervisor decided to give me a call to tell me. My supervisor basically said they don’t see it as exposure since the family hasn’t tested positive (yet) and it’s basically a “I know someone who had symptoms” situation. I told the company I didn’t feel safe to go into other clients homes without knowing for sure the family and myself are negative so I asked for a few days off to get tested. She then gave me a number for a nurse hotline to ask for a second opinion (they said self isolate and get tested). My supervisor proceeded to tell me since they don’t believe I was exposed and they’re expecting me back at work or I can use my sick hours to get testing done. I have another coworker who was exposed last week (similar situation) and is getting paid for time off and had the option to switch to telehealth services. When I reached out once again to switch to telehealth my supervisor told me it wasn’t possible. So now I’m debating even staying with the company since they’re not taking it serious. Am I overreacting? What do I do now?"
"Have you ever been on a ventilator?  I was for 2 months. If you think it is hard to breathe with a piece of cloth over your face, try doing it with a tube down your throat.  They strap your arms down so you don’t try to yank it out when you wake up in a panic.  Try not drinking water for 60 days.  Try sitting in the dark accepting that you are probably going to die and you can not say any last words to your kids.  No last hug, no kisses, just a thumbs up and a glassy glance through sedated eyes.  This all happened to me.  I survived and it breaks my heart for all the people who died like that.  For all of you who piss and moan about wearing a mask for a few minutes while you are around other people, you have no idea how bad life can get.  We all wear pants, but that is a decency law.  Well so is a mask.  It isn’t protecting you, it is protecting everyone around you.  It is protecting people like me.  I did not have COVID, but if I get it, I will likely die from it.  It is human decency.  If you think it hurts to wear a mask, when you’re on a ventilator they do a thing called suction,  where they shove a cord down your throat which causes you to cough so they can pull fluids out of your lungs.  It feels like getting hit with a baseball bat, in the chest, in slow motion, while coughing.  I had it done 10 to 15 times a day.  That is pain.  In the beginning I almost died with a mask on. And now I have ptsd every time I put one on. So I understand not wanting to wear one.  But i don’t ever want my mom or my kids or anyone to needless go through living on a vent.  Would you hit your mom with a baseball bat in the chest?  Would you let someone else?  Everytime I see someone not taking the simplest of precautions, all I see is them swinging a baseball bat.  Eventually they will hit someone.  Eventually they will hit someone you love.  Forget the law, wear a mask to be a decent human"
"A #CDC internal document obtained by the #NYT says that reopening K-12 schools and universities is the 'highest risk' of further spread of #Covid19. #Trump has no Constitutional authority to open schools, and its well past time for Governors to show some backbone [https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/politics/cdc-documents-warn-high-risk-schools-reopening/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/11/politics/cdc-documents-warn-high-risk-schools-reopening/index.html)"
"Hello, I'm from Kazakhstan and I don't know where to write about this. Right now Kazakhstan is on lock down again, people are dying massively. We've got so much humanitarian help from other countries and yet no one knows where it went. Some say the government put it to the pharmacies and it's super expensive, others say that it's all stolen.We don't have any paracetamol, all hospitals are overfilled and testing for this covid is so costly. We are suffering and our government doesn't care, all they can do is steal and lie.Recently we had an incident in Shymkent city, where an old lady was dying and her family spent 250000 tenge to buy oxygen for her. Their mother suffocated to death because doctors gave that oxygen to another person.When I heard about this, I felt terrified for my family and myself. We are all scared and losing hope, we lost our jobs and there's no support from the government. All medication costs a fortune.we don't know what to do anymore, I'm writing this because I want people to know and I want you to be careful. If you can suggest where else I could write this, please do so. My mother said that stuff that are happening right now in our country is close to being a genocide.Stay safe everyone."
There is a lot of talk about the high risk of opening schools this fall but there seems to be little to no talk of risk with the daycares opening now. Why is the risk appear differant? Kids in daycare are likely to social distance a lot less than in school.
"As I was putting on my mask after I got out of my car in the Walmart parking lot, someone deliberately made eye contact with me and did a ""thumbs up"" motion.  I nodded and smiled (hopefully it showed in my eyes) and went on my way.    I've been looking back at that moment a lot all day, and I think I'm going to do the same thing the next time I'm out.  Maybe a bit of encouragement for the people who are doing it right will do more than attempting to shame the people who don't think they have to care for their fellow human beings.    Anyway, I thought I'd share that with everyone.  And a big thumbs-up to everyone who's out there trying to stay safe!"
"I havent seen them in forever and I live a little far away from them but just found out my sister, her husband, and their two kids have covid. Her husband had to be hospitalized. If it wasnt real enough for me before it is now. Wear ypur masks and dont put yourself in unnecessary risky situations. Get your groceries and go the he home. This virus doesnt care about your political affiliations, race, religion or any sort of agenda."
"I remember when AIDS was a new thing and even not so new and many people, whom I think you would classify as conservatives wanted to actually separate AIDS victims/HIV+  people despite the fact that the disease was known not to be easily transmitted.I think it ironic that the same political conservatives are the ones who are somehow against wearing masks today and in fact want to congregate when Covid19 is highly transmissible. I could be wrong but that is my take on it."

"I was hospitalized in the COVID ward for 1 day, had 14 different tests done on me, was diagnosed positive even though my nasal saw was negative, and 1 month later had a blood test that was negative. I don't know what to think. The doctor who saw me in the COVID told me it was covid and if it wasn't it was MERS or SARS - that there was zero other explanation. The verologist told me that they are hearing rumors of two strains. Its all so confusing."
"Did anyone that had COVID before ever have some really vivid and lifelike dreams? The past week or so that I've been quarantined at a hotel I've had some really crazy dreams that seem so lifelike and I usually don't have dreams in general, kinda wondering what the cause might be. I can remember them in such crazy and vivid detail and it's like unreal."
This could encourage the little ones to wear them too!
"So. The last few months have been....interesting. Covid and shutdowns, then protests followed by riots. People are scared and confused. Information about the virus has changed rapidly, leaving many with a deep feeling of distrust. And the economic realities we face are daunting. Masks have become a major issue in many places. Many question how well masks really will work. Some even go so far as to insist masks are part of a nefarious plot. This post isn't to demean or even question the validity of the anti mask people or the pro mask people. This post is to show people the opportunity this health crisis has afforded us.If wearing a mask is good, then why wear a boring old mask? I say we make 2020 fun. Wear a Halloween costume with a mask that will function as well as what is being recommended in your area.And if you are against masks, consider it a protest as you go into your local grocery store dressed up. They think masks save lives do they? Well think how righteous a sweet Darth Vader outfit with an n95 mask underneath your voice changing helmet?I mean depending on your area...likely aren't breaking any rules. Obviously look into that before you do it. But where it's legal, we could bring a little whimsy into this dismal year. Think about it. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in the yellow suits are in produce, there's a sweet werewolf in housewares, and a crazy headless horseman in sporting goods. We can get through this together, no matter your stance, with the power of Halloween. I hope you will join me in this movement to make 2020 a little less awful. I'll be in frozen foods dressed as Subzero."

"Hey So I went to work a day after taking the COVID test , I don’t have the results . I took the test because I was curious , now I’ve been feeling sick. Headaches, feverish, chills. My question . Do I text my boss and let them know about the test I took yesterday ? Or just that I don’t feel well and go get retested ? I’m worried that they will take away my job because I “exposed” the office.  I can’t go to work regardless ,because of the symptoms I’ve been experiencing. I guess I’m more concerned with how to approach the matter....help?"
I have been stuck in my house all year. AMERICA PLEASE WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE COVID GO AWAY!!!!! WEAR MASKS. STAY HOME. DO WHAT IT TAKES.
Florida continues to rise in positive Covid-19 cases! What are some ways you are protecting yourselves and preventing the spread of Covid? If you ever thought about a much needed deep clean for your home or business give us a shout.
I want to simultaneously be a body guard for the employee standing out front telling people they have to wear a mask while pulled up (socially distanced of course) with a chair and a bowl of popcorn watching these idiots where I live in the south LOSE their freaking mind.
Does anyone ever see a video of a grocery store or any public place that has a lot of people before the virus happened and see them all not wearing masks and just compare it to what we see today? Or is that just me 😂
"Hey guys!I’m on a mobile, so I apologize for any grammar errors.. Back in March 2020, my(23F) husband (26M) and 2 toddlers were living at my parents’ house as we were in the process of buying a house. However, we started to feel unsafe as my family was not taking covid seriously.. My brother was still going out to clubs (pre closing Texas), my sister was going to friends’ houses, and no masks were being used when going out. Therefore, we decided to leave all of our things (furniture, cookware, dinning, etc) there and just take a few belongings with us to my sister in law’s house. Belongings being a canister of clothes for the kids and us plus a stroller. Our closing date was scheduled for July 10th so it was only going to be for a few months.. no biggie. And they had strict rules in place such as disinfecting everything from the store, etc. about 2 weeks before our closing, my family tells me they are displaying covid symptoms.. so they go get tested.. sure enough, it’s positive. I start freaking out because I’m not able to go see them whatsoever or hug them or help them feel better. I feel completely and utterly helpless. Luckily, they only had mild symptoms: fever, diarrhea, cough. July 10th comes around, we sign for the house and move in sleeping in air mattresses.. July 11th my father (70M) brings all of our items and places them in our garage for us. We did not have any contact whatsoever as they’re still displaying symptoms. (I felt so bad not being able to go out there and hug him..) My worry is this: we really need to start going in there and getting things out and into the home.. should we wait a few more days? We have appliances in there along with toys etc. I’m just so scared that I’d be putting my kids at risk and there’s nowhere in the internet saying that there’s no risk.. we are disinfecting everything and letting it sit over night to dry.. am I being too paranoid?Okay.. rant over... thanks guys in advance for any advice"
I need an emergency blood thinner refill. (Why dont pharmacies warn you when you pick up your last refill?) All attempts at contacting my doctor have failed. Im homeless without a working phone. I think ill be forced to visit the ER as even one missed dose could be fatal. But like I was a heavy smoker for so long on top of having multiple bloodclotting diseases (which covid exacerbates)  that I dont think i would survive covid. I only have the shitty masks too not the good ones. Basically im scared of dying if i dont get my meds but scared of dying of covid if I go to the ER. I dont know what to do. I only have one pair of clothing so I cannot wash my clothes afterwards if I visit the ER.How risky would an ER visit be if im stuck in the same clothes I wear to the hospiltal?
"I work at a location that I feel doesn’t have the best interest for us employees. This is only my opinion. I had to get retested for COVID-19 at work and went in to get swabbed. I got swapped with a 6inch q-tip looking swap collector thing. They only swabbed superficially inside  my nostril and not any deeper like I had other locations do. Since I don’t know anything about Covid testing , was this procedure correctly done? When I got sick my whole family got sick, and one month later I still have unexplained headaches and nausea and I think my sense of smell and taste is going away again , I’m not too sure. Is there a higher margin of error if the swab only collected whatever it was suppose to collect in the nostril superficially.? Thank you  The reason I’m suspicious is because they are very low on employees and when I asked for some time off to help my parents get better they said they weren’t granting personal time off requests due to low staffing and that If I don’t show up for work it can be considered job abandonment which of course I did not want to do. So of course I went back to work."
What's up! Currently my high school is receiving tons of hate for mandating masks for this upcoming school year. It would be great if you could sign this petition that supports the schools decision! All help is welcome!  http://chng.it/VcZvRRLD
"We had some plumbing work done and there were two guys working on it. In conversation I mentioned the pandemic, one responded that it's a hoax. It took a moment for me to realize he was serious. He said he's been to a hospital and he didn't see any COVID patients. It's all a plan to crash the economy ""Ever notice how the economy crashes every 10 years or so? This is how they're doing it this time."" He said hospitals are just coding normal stuff as COVID to drive up the numbers.Nothing penetrated that shield of willful ignorance. ""I can provide first had accounts""...""I won't believe them"".Several days later I'm still shaking my head at the level of stupidity that takes.To his credit, the plumbing work was good. The company he works for requires masks and he wore one any time I was around. He even admonished his helper for not getting his on when I walked up to their truck once.I knew these people existed but to talk to one and hit that absolute wall of ignorance was very disconcerting and frustrating."
"Mongolia has had NO community transmission, NO deaths, and only 287 cases. Western press is not extolling them for this, as they are us (NZ), yet they have a superior outcome, with a much denser urban population. It's nuts.  It is just because they're not a Western country?&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/3wi3a2zruvb51.png?width=2118&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f348adbc620abab9319bc1e3f04483929df2227"
"Maybe they think that wearing a mask in public labels you as sick? Or it looks weird? Im genuinely confused cause if u look at south korea's numbers its ridiculously low and they never went into lockdown everything was still open Also south korea is one of the most dense populated areas in the world, the spread should have been crazy.The difference? Everyone wears masks.... its more common in korean culture to wear a mask even befoe this covid eraIts really obvious, like do u want people to spray covid drops on your face? Or would u rather try keep an invisible 1.5 meters? Lol how about wear a fking mask!??!? So stupid its unbelievable..."
"https://twitter.com/shesinscrubs/status/1284950366744989696?s=20 Please read and ***share*** this Twitter thread; it outlines the inhumane and criminal conditions COVID-19 patients are undergoing. We need help, and we know that the governor would rather let us all die than actually care about the latinx lives of the RGV."
My grandmother just woke me up in the middle of the night confused asking me things that we discussed not 30 minutes ago. We were discussing some events that happened last week she was involved but she completely forgot what happened. She is walking around the house trying to gather herself. This has NEVER happen with her before and I’m worried as hell at the moment.I know a symptom of covid 19 is confusion but to what extent? Is it possible to completely forget something you were clearly involved in and witnessed happen?? She also seems to have a stomach bug she’s used the bathroom multiple times and has thrown up. Please someone talk to me..
"Yesterday I had a birthday party for my daughter. I invited only the closest relatives (gramma and grandpas, uncles and two of my best friends) and children from our street came to the party. Those are the people that I have contact with almost EVERY DAY so possible infection would be inevitable. In the middle of the party my brother got a phone call from the police. He was informed that his colleague has Corona. He is hospitalized. The brother left the party immediately. I told everyone what has happened. Brother did one test and he is negative but we are waiting for another one. This is insane. People will go mad. Hospital is slowly collapsing and people still think it's unreal. I'm so afraid for everyone."
"No other symptoms, I've been eating popsicles (which I could taste perfectly fine) and drinking loads of water.  I started to feel this last night, I am so scared and have no idea what to expect."
"i have plead with my parents to take this pandemic seriously, but they're settled with doing the bare minimum (wear a mask; use hand sanitisers). meanwhile, they gaslight me when i take precautions that they deem excessive.eventually, when lockdown in my country was lifted, despite the cases continuing to rise, my mother returned to work mostly because she was bored. i never understood this because she is not the breadwinner. weeks later, she comes home with a cough. then my father gets it, i get it and finally, my little brother gets it too!im so pissed, because i had always expressed my concerns, but they continued to dismiss them as 'overreactions', and would get visibily annoyed at me for stating facts??i will never forgive my parents for their carelessness. even after getting tested, the health proffessionals encouaraged us to stay home until we get our results back. what do my parents do? my father goes out and my mother returns to work, placing all the people they interact with at risk!they persistently reason their nonchalantness with the relatively low cases in our city, but that is NO reason to not take the needed precautions.beyond being physically compromised by all of this, mentally, im not doing great either because im confronted with my heightened mortality; the possibility of enduring long-term effects in relation to this disease and the reality that is my gaslighting family.***update:thank you all so much for the condolences. our tests came in early, and we are COVID POSITIVE.Please maintain social distancing, especially if you have the privilege/ability to; continue to sanitize; wear masks; keep meters away from others etc."
"In December last year I went through a couple of weeks with no appetite. I could only eat about half a meal a day and in the end I lost weight. Didn’t think too much of it until I realised this is now seen as a symptom of covid19. Since then I have developed a regular pins and needles type feeling in the fingers on both hands. My partner has reported this as well. I believe this is seen as a symptom too.We have both been isolating since early March, don’t go out without gloves and masks. All food and drink is delivered and we even wear masks and gloves when that comes.We haven’t been tested but I believe we have had it and I don’t think we are infectious. My question is about the pins and needles. Is there a treatment? Will it go away? It’s not incapacitating, do we need to treat it at all?"
"The person at the front desk, receptionist, maybe a nurse? Pulled her mask down to sneeze. What the actual fuck? I reported the incident to the doctor."
"All the symptoms of strep minus the sore throat for us. We were diagnosed sunday. You really do lose your sense of taste and smell. I mean you lose them all the way. Its hitting my husband worse than myself or our son. Husbands temp is staying steady at 101 and tylenol is not bringing it down. So far we do not have a cough. Hopefully we don't get one. We feel very tired, the smallest task wears us out."
"I just have to get this off my chest. Nobody ever wants to speak plainly anymore. Its all about sparing feelings and participation trophies. Enough!I am so sick of reading about people that dont want to wear a mask, or stop any aspect of their lives...even though it means saving the lives of others. How callous and selfish can a person be?People that are running around trying to pretend everything is normal is why the virus is out of control. They are the problem.  They are more dangerous than the virus because the virus is mindless and they are making conscious decisions that put others at risk. People feeling entitled. People choosing not to believe what experts are telling them. People just not caring unless or until it directly affects them. This is the 2 pack a day smoker that doesn't believe his doctor that smoking causes caancer...until the lung cancer hits. Then he quits. Then he dies 6 months later. And he never thinks that now is family has lung issues from inhaling his second-hand smoke for 30 years.People also seem to have a problem sacrificing anything at all for the greater good. They seem to care about themselves than anyone else. They prove this by going to restaurants, going shopping, going to bars, going to the beach, getting hair cuts, not social distancing, not wearing a mask, etc.The whole country is about to go into another shut down because of the people that do these things. People are getting sick and dying because people are doing these things. But let's not say any of that out loud cause we don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.Well, maybe its time to hurt a few feelings. Maybe we should stop enabling people by saying ""we understand"". Maybe it should not be socially acceptable for people to put others' lives at risk.If a person waves a gun around and it accidentally goes off and kills someone is that person not responsible? We know the gun is loaded, people! This virus kills. But if there is no system of accountability many people behave with impunity. Unless the virus hits them or a loved one too many people will continue to do what they want to do, no matter how if affects others. Maybe its time to say something about that.So to all of you that do not wear a mask, and do not social distance, and cannot be bothered to to do anything that might help save lives: You SUCK! You are killing people. You are making people sick. You are sinking our economy. You are costing people their livelihood. YOU are the problem. I dont know how you sleep at night and I will not hand out participation trophies to spare your feelings. If you choose to drive drunk and kill someone, you are responsible. If you choose to act against medical safety guidelines that are in place to save lives you are also responsible. Stop making excuses and just own the fact that you are acting selfishly and that you dont care if others are in trouble, as long as it isnt you. Recognize it. Admit it. Own it. But stop deceiving yourself about what you are and stop expecting the rest of us to accept it or excuse it."
"He got upset at this article.https://www.newsweek.com/narcissists-psychopaths-face-mask-requirement-mandate-social-distancing-covid-19-coronavirus-1519732He flipped out saying that the definition of a narcissist is somebody who likes to control others, so by their own logic that makes Fauci a narcissist because he want everybody to stay inside and away from everyone, thus controlling them. Is that true?"
"I went to meet some friends recently, people gathered together with no social security measures at all. I was the only one there wearing a mask and felt that people were looking at me like I am some sort of weirdo.  A second wave is starting (as expected) and I am expecting a lot of people to die as a result.  Also, I still feel with a certain disappointment that a lot of people don't give a damn about it. Am I living in such a parallel universe, is it just me or....?"
"I need advice. When I was a small child I was abused really bad. To the point that I have been told that I have PTSD from it. One of my triggers is anything covering my face. My father would tape my mouth shut when I was playing ""too loud."" I'm not anti mask in the slightest. I see the need for them. I have even been practicing trying to wear one. But I just can't. No matter how hard I try it triggers such intense panic attacks that I can't even function as a proper human. I use a facesheld at work. Which I can handle just fine. But if we get to the point of having to wear masks I don't know if I could. I work a job where working from home is not an option. I cant go on ei because that was used up for mat leave. I can't afford to just stay home because I have a young child to look after. I honestly do not know what to do. I know you can get an exemption from your doctor. But would they be willing to give it to me for this reason? If I can continue to wear the shield and SoCal distance then maybe I'd be fine. But I don't know what work will decide."
 Apparently this will be the new trend.  Got a letter telling me my identity has been stolen so I have to go online to verify. Basically had to refile my taxes and when I jump through a dozen hoops it ended by telling me that this is still wasn't enough and I had to call the IRS.  Of course nobody actually answers at the IRS. It's just a recording telling you to try again tomorrow. So in other words I'm fucked.

Not sure how to word this or where I am even going with it. One of my friends roommate just recently tested positive for COVID but still doesn't believe the disease is real and thinks it is a conspiracy. I kind of want to hear the thoughts of the people this has happened too. Did anyone get severely sick with COVID symptoms but think it was something else. Were anyone of you thinking this was made up but changed your mind once you contracted it first hand?
"They think that the numbers are conflated and that they shouldnt be barred from attending live church. They think that just because a few of their friends have been diagnosed with COVID without them having taken the test, that this is happening to everyone in the US.Yes, the US healthcare system is shoddy, but they arent conflating anything, and why would they even NEED to convince people that the numbers are conflated? What would that gain?Also, one of my family members doesnt think that a 7.5% mortality rate is significant.Edit: my brother brought up the 7.5% through his sources (he said that the news was more reliable than hospitals, because nurses and doctors are biased), but thanks to a very kind redditor, i now know that the mortality rate veries across countries, and the mortality rate for the US is different. It depends on where you are located.Here's the link that the user posted [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)Thanks, dude for correcting me. And although the US mortality rate is much less, i still believe that my family is underestimating things.So yeah, please help me find where to look to show them how bad all of this is. (And apparently, although they use anecdotal evidence from friends, anecdotal evidence from nurses and doctors doesnt cause because ""nurses and doctors are biased""🙄)Edit: All of these responses are extremely helpful and i thank all of you guys for responding!! Tonight, im going to confront the family with your suggestions and Ill post an update to show you guys how it goes!!"
I’m not trying to start a fierce debate here but am interested in understanding how a global pandemic became such an American political tug-of-war. It doesn’t seem like anyone is benefiting. I am inclined to follow the science which I know there’s been a huge ramp up in the understanding of the virus but to discredit scientists worldwide who will share information as they learn seems unfortunate. There also seems to be a steady stream of individuals with conspiracy theories that don’t acknowledge this is a global phenomenon just an American one.
"Work doesnt care since I don't have a fever but i feel like complete crap. Not sure if I should go get tested or wait like work said. I have:-sore throat -constant chest pain-breathing causes chest pain-nausea-fatigue-eyes are burning-mouth is dry and tastes gross My brain feels like foggy, like I'm not there mentally. We did have someone test positive less than a week ago and I only know because I asked why they hired a deep cleaning crew out of nowhere. I feel like getting tested is the right thing to do but work isnt pushing it like its important."
" Honestly  the United States could’ve been finished with COVID by now but people can’t just stay home or go out when necessary and not to mention can’t wear a  mask. I guarantee everything will be shut down again by the end of  August or September. This isn’t going away anytime soon. Our country is  the joke of the world right now. The problem with a lot of people in many countries (especially the United States) with ignoring social distancing and being stupid is everyone thinks that ""oh it probably won't happen to me, and if it does i will survive""People need to stop thinking that this is all about them and that they are invincible. in some way because this could happen to everyone. I can guarantee if people continue to act the way they do the States are gonna shut everything down and it will be a lot longer then a monthPlease have common sense people. Listen to the Doctors. Stay home and do your part in making this go away so we can get back to some sort of normalicy. My grandmother died from this and both my parents currently have COVID 19. Luckily they are both recovering well."
"I am currently trying to get a count of COVID Deaths in America versus a total count of deaths in 2020 so far, and compare this figure to past years. However, I am having trouble GROSS death counts (2020 present, and previous years). Could someone direct me to some reliable sources on this?"
" This isn't my story but it's a huge story in Australia right now so I thought I'd share it here for people not in Australia. I've never heard of people this entitled and what they did was outright despicable and they are being publicly shamed for their actions which is deserved. There is a huge outbreak in Melbourne Victoria and 2 of these women, knowingly infected, attended a party, restaurants and traveled freely around infected areas. The state of Victoria is in panic mode because of these women. This article is copy and pasted from an online news article.**Three Queensland women will face court for dodging quarantine after returning to the Sunshine State from Melbourne while infected with COVID-19.**Three Brisbane women who allegedly lied on their border declaration forms to avoid quarantining after a trip to Victoria have been charged.Police will allege they traveled to the COVID-19 hotspot and deliberately misled authorities when crossing back into Queensland.Two of the women have been diagnosed with the illness and all three are now in quarantine.A 19-year-old from Heritage Park and two 21-year-olds from Acacia Ridge and Algester have each been charged with a count of fraud and a count of providing false or misleading documents under the Public Health Act.The fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of five years behind bars, while the second offence carries a maximum fine of $13,345.Earlier, police said one of the virus-positive women was upfront about where she had been in recent weeks, but the other had refused to give authorities her details.Police believe they attended a party while in Victoria, and say all three women are now cooperating with them and Queensland Health officials.They are due to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on 28 September.A criminal investigation is also proceeding, which is unrelated and not connected to their alleged travel to Victoria.A massive contact tracing mission is underway after they visited shopping centres, restaurants, a school and a church, while aged care centres have been closed.The state recorded an additional three new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday.One man in his 20s who recently returned from the United States is in hotel quarantine, while a couple who ate at The Apollo restaurant in Sydney's Pott Point - where there has been a small outbreak - have gone into isolation.None are connected to three young women.Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was seething at the breach of COVID-19 protocols as she announced the Queensland border would be shut to people from Sydney from Saturday.""I'm absolutely furious that this has happened,"" Ms Palaszczuk said.However, Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young has indicated it's unlikely the borders will again be closed to all states and territories.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on the premier to publicly release the health advice behind the decision to shut the border to anyone from Sydney.""I think whatever decisions premiers are taking, they have to explain them and they have to outline to the public what the medical advice is to support those decisions,"" he told reporters in Canberra."
"I keep seeing things here that scare me. They scare me because I cannot believe that with all the information available, people still do not seem to know when to isolate or how to be safe.Ive also read some stories from people that got covid ""in spite of taking all precautions. Then I see that they took tons of risks my family would never take. Why are you surprised when you were outside without a mask, near people that didnt wear a mask, didnt wash hands enough, didnt wear gloves when handling packages or groceries, didnt allow time for items to decontaminate, diidnt social distance, and insisted on going out to places for services like coffee or haircuts? Duh...of course you caught it!Some quick reference answers to questions here:1. Should you isolate if you have been near a covid positive person? Duh! YES! It doesn't matter if its your grandmother or boyfriend or neighbor. Were you closer than 6 to 12 feet? Thats exposure. Working in the same workspace? Thats exposure. Same car? Exposure. Why are people still spinning scenarios and asking if they should isolate? Are they hoping that enough details will change the answer? So they are just hoping for a specific result because they dont like the truth?2. Should you wear a mask and social distance if nobody feels sick? YES. Asymptomatic don't have noticeable symptoms but are still contagious. It doesnt matter if everyone ""seems fine"". You can infect people in the days before you have a symptom.3. Can you get covid from talking to someone? YES! if they have covid. That is why every medical expert told you to wear a mask and social distance. Talking, breathing, singing...any time air leaves a persons mouth it can carry virus. How likely you are to become infected depends pon several variables...all of which are mitigated by masks and social distancing.4. Should you do something if your workplace is ignoring guidelines or putting people at risk? YES! Call the health department and OSHA to report them. Post online so that people in your community know what businesses are putting employees/customers at risk. If you are worried about retaliation create an anonymous account to post. Call or email the news to your local newspaper. Post it on NEXTDOOR, INDEED, and LINKEDIN. And dont forget about protections offered with the Whistle-Blowers Act.5. Should you isolate if you think you have symptoms or may have been exposed? YES. Isolate for 14 days and see how things go. If it gets worse get a test. You may want to get a test anyway before being around anyone else. And wear a mask so you dont get others sick!6. Should I pull down or remove my mask? NO! whats the point of wearing a mask if you take it off to eat or drink? If the mask comes down you expose others and eliminate any potential protection. If their mask comes down they just put you at risk and you should probably isolate so that you do not put your loved ones at risk.7. Should you have people over? NO! Well...should you have unprotected sex? If you do you might get an STD. If you have friends over and someone has covid (with or without symptoms) you might get infected. Not difficult math.8. Is it safe to travel and have vacations? NO! That is why the CDC website specifically says to please avoid unnecessary travel.9. Can I live my life as I did before covid and be around my loved ones without posing a risk? NO! If you are out and about - not wearing a mask/not social distancing/coming in contact with people not wearing masks - you are a danger to your loved ones. And anyone else you come in contact with. If you have a person in your life that is high-risk, you should not be anywhere near them. How would you feel if you got them sick? Make a choice...roll your dice however you like, but dont rob others of making their own choice.&amp;#x200B;Edit to add: By the way...for all the people asking these questions...please do not stop asking! I am glad you are looking for answers!! I am just surprised that these questions are still being asked. But the only way to get everyone into a good position is for everyone to have the information. Kudos for looking for answers!"
"Remember a time when you passed someone in the street who was smoking?  Remember how you could still inhale their smoke for some distance?That's how it is with Covid 19.WHAT THEY BREATH OUT, YOU BREATH IN.WEAR A MASK!"

"The idea that you wear a face masksto protect other people is a dangerous idea!  It leads to the stupid reasoning:I should wear a face mask to protect others.  But I don't have Covid 19.  So, I don't need to wear a face mask.WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!What others breath out, you breath inWEAR A MASK!"

"Since I gotten Covid and now recovering,my sleep has been terrible I end up waking up mid day not in the mornings anymore and still feel extremely tired like I slept 2 hours , if I put a alarm to wake up early (8-9am) I feel drowsy or delayed."
" Laws are only enacted when a large population of people are unable to act responsibly of their own accord. If there were no thieves, there would never have been laws about theft. If people could have been trusted to not drive drunk, the drunk driving laws would not have started in 1906. Today, lawmakers are scrambling to help protect society on a micro-level, addressing the health and financial needs of households, cities, counties, etc. But with no end in sight and so many people unwilling to act responsibly on their own, it is inevitable that our country will end up passing new laws to control the behavior of those who cannot be trusted to control themselves.Before you say “that will never happen!” think about this. One year ago it was unthinkable that we would need laws to stop people from opening ice cream containers or other grocery items, licking the contents, then returning them to the shelf. But apparently we did need those laws and so now it is a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison in some states. And it wasn’t just grocery items, remember? Subway poles, stair rails, elevator buttons…these morons were licking everything and posting videos online. Do you really think those people stopped doing that when Covid hit?When HIV swept the nation there were no laws regarding sexual behavior. And after all, HIV was a disease…you cant control a disease, right? Wrong! You might not be able to control the disease you have, but you can control your behavior that spreads that disease, so the courts decided that if you know you have HIV and do not inform your sexual partners you can be held legally and financially responsible. Almost every state has some form of law/ statute in place addressing this issue.Fast forward to today. Three months ago nobody thought we would need laws to force infected people to honor quarantine. Now they can be arrested and fined. Three months ago nobody thought we would need court orders and fines to force people to report who they had been in contact with, now we are issuing subpoenas and levying fines of up to $2000 a day for non-compliance.But we still have people running around without masks and not social distancing. If those people are asymptomatic they are infecting others, putting lives at risk and forcing high medical costs onto those they infect. Do you really think this behavior will be allowed to continue indefinitely? People are sick and dying, people are losing jobs, the economy is in serious trouble…all because these people will not behave responsibly. This is the very reason “rule of law” was invented!Why should a single mother of three get stuck with $34,000 of medical bills because a co-worker would not wear a mask and her employer did nothing to keep them safe? Why should a family forever lose a father/husband, and be financially ruined because someone came in contact with them not wearing a mask? These people wore masks and took precautions, but because they were unable to avoid people who did not take precautions, their lives are forever impacted. And to make matters worse there is no way to gauge “intent”. There is no way to tell which people are passing on the disease intentionally or through ignorance. Before you scoff, think about the ice cream lickers and the HIV positive people that have spit in someone’s face. I have no doubts that there are people who see this as their own private bio-weapon that nobody can detect or take away from them. And there is no reason to fear being caught because there is no penalty for infecting others.That will change. Laws will come. Like all other legal precedents, lawmakers will eventually realize that this pandemic will never end as long as people as left to their own “honor”.At some point someone will die with a clear line of infection and the family will sue the employer/co-worker/neighbor/ that infected them. They might even contend it was done on purpose. They will seek restitution for medical bills and demand punishment.  Eventually, someone will be able to prove that the person who infected them did so because they took no reasonable precautions as advised by the CDC.It is the height of irony that the people who protest the most about “losing their rights” are always the same people whose behavior precipitates the need for the new laws they are protesting against."
"By total number of deaths I mean ALL deaths, not just covid deaths. Suicide, heart attack, car wreck, etc. A friend of mine said that between March-May 2020 ~110k more people died than the 5 year average. I cannot find anything tracking this, however.I’ve done some digging and found a source from the NYT. They say there is a huge delay in a lot of states on issuing death certificates rn so don’t trust recent says. Between March and mid July there are 200k extra deaths."
"So I recently found out my sister doesn’t believe in the use of mask and finds them rather useless. She tells me it’s been proven multiple times that masks don’t really help and therefore she won’t wear one unless mandatory. I’m worried because she has two daughters (who she does care for and is a great mother to) and I just want her to be safe for her sake and for their sake. Can I get an help to convince her why she should wear a mask? I would also appreciate if we can keep the conversation civil with no arguing. Thank you, hope everyone is doing well!!"
"Anti-maskers do not need a  fact-based reason for not wearing a mask, they just dont want to. So  facts probably wont change their mind. They may say that they dont belive in the virus or that masks dont work, but the reality is they just dont care about other people. If you look hard at other instances or patterns in the time you have known them you will probably spot clues to that selfishness.  We were just unable to see it so openly before.We are all now learning what kind of human being the people we come into contact with are. Im sorry to say it but if someone is outside without a mask you pretty much know they are selfish and dont care about protecting others.  They are the kind of person that will put themselves first. These are  the people that save themselves and leave their friends behind in an emergency.We will probably never change their mind about masks because it is not their minds that need to change. This is the very core of the type of person they are. No matter what anyone says, an anti-masker will find a way to justify and excuse their behavior. And they will often become hostile if they feel their belief system is being challenged because they dont want other people to know what kind of person they really are. Or they dont want to be forced to see it in themselves.**As a clarification.**..I do believe that some people (especially young people or those with limited access to information) may not wear masks yet out of confusion and ignorance. This post is NOT about them. I am taking about the hard core anti-maskers that refuse to wear a mask even though they have read all the guidlines, seen the news, and know exactly what is going on. They talk about their rights, they make excuses about when/where they dont want to wear a mask, etc. Their very excuses indicate they know they are making an informed decision. A decision that puts their comfort/convenience above the well being of others."
"How  is it that so many people believe in a god without any proof at all,  but cannot seem to grasp the reality of a virus that has killed almost  700,000 people worldwide. It has shattered economies in every country  and overwhelmed healthcare systems. People who have survived will face  huge medical bills and possibly lifelong lung and heart impairment. People who do not believe covid is real at this point probably will not accept the truth until they are dying from it.**The Parable of the Flood**A  man was trapped in his house during a flood. He began praying to  God  to rescue him. He had a vision in his head of God’s hand reaching  down  from heaven and lifting him to safety. The water started to rise in  his  house. His  neighbour urged him to leave and offered him a ride to   safety. The man yelled back, “I am waiting for God to save me.” The   neighbour drove off in his pick-up truck.The  man continued to pray and hold on to his vision. As the water  began  rising in his house, he had to climb up to the roof. A boat came  by  with some people heading for safe ground. They yelled at the man to   grab a rope they were ready to throw and take him to safety. He told   them that he was waiting for God to save him. They shook their heads and   moved on.The man continued to  pray, believing with all his heart that he would  be saved by God. The  flood waters continued to rise. A helicopter flew  by and a voice came  over a loudspeaker offering to lower a ladder and  take him off the  roof. The man waved the helicopter away, shouting back  that he was  waiting for God to save him. The helicopter left. The  flooding water  came over the roof and caught him up and swept him away.  He drowned.When  he reached the pearly gates he asked, “God, why did you not save me? I  believed  in you with all my heart. Why did you let me drown?” God  replied, “I  sent you a pick-up truck, a boat and a helicopter and you  refused all  of them. What else could I possibly do for you?”"
"A coworker has recently been on a vacation and says she has no sense of taste or smell and feels like she has a cold or allergies. She worked yesterday and the owners of the coffee shop are going to let her come into work later today without having a test. What can I do? They are just going to pretend it’s not happening. Several other coworkers went in for testing and they never informed anyone else. They are new business owners and no one even wears a mask at work unless they want to. I feel like it’s some kind of violation or endangerment. Is there something I can do?Edit: thank you everyone for responding. I’m waiting to see if she does show up and I have a N95 mask in the meantime. They say they have a obligation to protect her health information until she’s tested positive but I think that’s BS. I don’t know if she’s planning on getting tested. It was a few coworkers who went on vacation together and now she’s showing symptoms but only a couple people at work know. I’m going to make sure our boss knows and see what kind of action they take, knowing she was working this weekend. They should be reported. They haven’t made any changes to the sanitation procedures. No masks and only dish sanitizer."
"I work at a Dr's office and our office manager is notorious for doing whatever she wants (tho it's only seen as a problem by us reception peeps who have to fix all her dumbassery). She will be right in front of a patient and will still not be wearing a mask. I can't go to management about it because the last person who voiced concerns and pointed out where things were unlawful is now in contact with a lawyer because they fired her for ""performance concerns"". So either I bring up that things that are going on are unlawful and thus I suffer the same fate she did or I just bite my tongue and just make sure what I'm doing is lawful and I wear a mask. (The state we live in does have a mask mandate on top of it being a DOCTOR'S OFFICE!)What can I do? Is there an anonymous way to report that she is not complying with state mandate?Edit: Hey that's awesome, she got employee of the month"

"I work in a pharmacy and until recently we didn't require masks. I'm not here to debate the wisdom of that decision, but when I've been coughing for the past few days and woke up today with pressure in my chest and a sore throat - I'm just really scared. Could I have been exposing people at work? I saw a friend the other day and we stayed far apart and wore masks but could I have exposed her? We saw my grandparents outside the other day and we stayed far apart and wore masks again but could I have exposed them? I'm going over every single interaction I've had for weeks trying to think - did I do this right, did I wash my hands enough, wear my mask enough and I'm so scared. I don't know what to do and I can't get into a testing center until Thursday. I've been told to self isolate, but both my parents are working from home, my brother is busy, and we have a brand new dog that we need to keep an eye on. I don't know what to do and I'm really really scared. I know I keep repeating that but I don't know what else to say. If anyone has any advice or just comfort I'd be really grateful."
36 wks pregnant and tested positive again after testing positive in March.  No symptoms just had some early bleeding that I needed checked at the hospital.  I live in a low covid state and do not believe I was reinfected.  Ive also been very careful and social isolating/social distancing.  Infectious disease MDs believe i would not be spreading the infection and dont recommend quarantining.  My number one priority is protecting my friends/family and fellow citizens.  So far no one in the last 5 months have become covid positive after interacting with me but I literally quarantined for 10 wks in did not leave the house for 40 days after positive test.  I live in one of the least covid positive states in the country and re-infection is unlikely.  My initial infection i believe was from a plane(sick guy directly coughed on me 2 ft away).  I feel like a lepur and want to protect my friends/family/society and future baby.  Anyone have any studies that discuss long term covid positive or safety protocols.  Waiting for my obgyn to discuss with infectious disease.
"People say Trump has no covid plan. I think they are wrong. I think we are living his covid plan right now. It falls in line perfectly with all his other business plans:1. Shift investments for maximum profits2. Maneuver selected companies into supplier/vendor positions and give contracts to those companies so that the consumers/taxpayers foot the bill while making money through dividends on the back end.3. Place family member in a position to control the allocation of resources. Blackmail competition into complicity or remove them from the picture.4. Allow all unnecessary people to be let go (in this case to die) This will reduce costs and create an emotional smokescreen to distract from other illegal/unethical activities. It also has the benefit that once all vulnerable people have been killed off, he can claim ""it just went away like I said it would"".5. No matter what happens keep telling people you are doing a great job in hopes that if you say it enough times some people will start to believe it. Just like advertising."
"I don’t know why people aren’t talking about this. The US population is 330 Million with 158k deaths, while India has a 1.2 BILLION population with 38k DEATHS. And Trump wants to say COVID is under control, smh"
I find myself sitting in bed or on my bed most of the day. I don't (think) I have covid but quarantine's turned me into a lazy blob.
"If you are exposed to Covid, after how long after the initial exposure do you begin to become infectious? Is it right away?"
I live on my own. My dad lives with my brother and my mom has her own place. My dad wants me to come by and visit cuz we haven’t seen each-other in so long. I’ve been wearing my mask and washing my hands. I have the covid app and I haven’t come into contact with anyone infected. I’m terrified of something happening to my family. I wouldn’t be able to go on living.
"Before Covid hit there were thousands of cleaning products on the store shelves that claimed they killed viruses. It was on the packaging and it was in their advertisements.Once Covid hit the FDA released a list of cleaning products that actually killed viruses. About 5 of those store-bought products were on it.The other cleaning products have now changed their labels and removed the claim from their advertising.Remember that the next time you see an advertisement for anything.&amp;#x200B;Thanks to nikagda for adding links!Lysol and Clorox have been on there from the beginning, and Comet and Fantastik have made the cut. I think most of the others on the list are commercial cleaners, though Im sure they can be purchased at any janitorial supply.  I think of all the name brand products I used to see on the shelves that claimed to kill viruses, but of the 469 entries on this list, I recognize only 4 store name brands.Here is full EPA list:[https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19](https://www.epa.gov/pesticide-registration/list-n-disinfectants-use-against-sars-cov-2-covid-19)"
"Hi- I am reaching out for help and fact driven opinions. I work in an office setting with 14 other people in Alabama. A coworker felt bad all last week but didn't tell anyone. She left at lunch for a rapid test and tested positive for Covid-19. She did not return and told the CEO. After confronting the CEO, he responded that he did not to tell anyone because HIPAA. I am having a difficult time understanding the logic of not responding properly."
"There have been numerous scientific reports of a strong correlation between covid hospitalization and vitamin d deficiency (message me privately if you want the references); moreover, doctors have been saying for years that most people today are vitamin d deficient (due to using sunscreen and otherwise staying out of the sun). Pretty hard to prove causality but there are some interesting theories about pathways, because vitamin d is needed to create T-cells, which are the body's first line of defense against any invader. Question for those who suffered severe covid sickness: prior to getting sick, were you supplementing vitamin d? So far I've asked this to the 6 people I know who got seriously ill and 5 of them had not been supplementing."
"I had a covid-19 swab done last week. I've heard so many stories about people saying how uncomfortable it is because of how deep the swab goes.The nurse who gave me my test barely swabed the inside of my nose cavity, the MRSA and Flu swab tests Ive had done at the hospital have gone deeper than what they did.My results came back negative yesterday, but now I'm sort of wondering is it possible they did the test incorrectly?If they didn't swab all the way to the back of my sinuses how could they get any material enough to determine a positive or negative?Am I just being worried over nothing? I'd hate to stop quarantining and get someone sick because I had a false negative."
"I, 37 y/o male, am Covid positive.  Nagging cough, low grade fever, and body aches.So far so good.  This is day 2.  I was tested due to being around a known positive.  I thought I had allergies, and ended up having Covid instead.My wife and kids are in quarantine and I am stuck in isolation in the basement.  Not looking for sympathy, just wanted to share my story.  Like I am sure others have.  Anyway!  Time for a nap!"
"Where are you from and what does loving with COVID-19 look like for you now?Lately in the U.S. the divide in America seems to be growing quite large.  We are further wedged by debates over masks and other COVID Restrictions.  There seems to be a growing number of people who feel that the virus is not as dangerous as has been portrayed to us, and the state and local governments are leveraging the pandemic to push political agendas and extend government control.   Where I am in Virginia schools will be all virtual and there are still many restrictions in place as to what businesses can do or if they can be open at all. The news is filled with nothing other than bashing the other side of the political aisle, and reports of increasing case numbers.  There is very little about i death rates or cities building out surge capacity. Then it dawned on me that there is also very little news about places outside of the US.  So it got me wondering what does the rest of the world look like?  What restrictions are still in place? What other countries are still having major issues with the Pandemic? Is anyone back to “normal”?"
Pay every little kid $1.00 to point and ask in a loud voice...”Why isn’t that person wearing a mask?”  No adult can take being shamed by a little kid
"I read a thing a little bit ago (May-ish) that said if you and another person don’t leave your house and quarantine for 15 days before, it is safe to visit that person. Does this still apply? The CDC said it so I presume it’s factual. Anyone have a link where is says where that is/isn’t true? I’ve been searching for around an hour and have no luck."
"my school is re-opening this tuesday. they've taken ""precautions"" - we have to wash our hands at the start of the day and we have a ""one-way system"" in the corridors. but we aren't allowed to wear masks and we obviously can't social distance because of the size of the classrooms.they're not going to get a ""successful, safe and productive return to school"" because the precautions taken are not going to keep everyone safe. if even one person has the virus, it's going to spread. gathering 1,300 kids in a small assembly hall to discuss being safe seems ironic.maybe i'm wrong or misinformed, but going back to school right feels like a really bad idea and they're ignorant if they think this is going to go down well, especially with parents.what are people's thoughts?"

"I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I thought I would try.My girlfriend (18F) and I (17M) have been together for just under 16 months. In that time, her grandfather who she loves quickly developed dementia. Quickly like, tiny signs one day and then a couple months later he is in a home and completely unable to function or remember. Well, he tested positive for COVID-19 in the nursing home after suffering from a fever and pneumonia-like symptoms. He's deteriorating quickly and my girlfriend is devastated because she can never see him again (no visitation at the home whatsoever) and he's dying and can't understand what's happening to him. I don't know how to comfort her. I don't really have a reference. I've lost people, but not like that. Not where I know that they're dying, but can't see them, or talk to them in an understandable way. Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile. I am also sorry for rambling or if this is not a good place for this."
"Dear RedditI need your helpI am a 21 year old CNA at a veteran's nursing home in Central Alabama, I have worked there for almost 2 years now and I love the part of my job where I take care of these people- I work with dementia and alzheimers here. My veterans are near and dear to my heart and I could honestly do this job forever if it didn't put such wear and tear on my body. What I don't love is the abuse and the mistreatment of my coworkers, especially now during this pandemic. Back during the beginning of July, two of my coworkers became stricken with Covid-19, the first cases we had in the facility. Now, it is August 8th, 2020. And 15 of my coworkers have Covid-19. We got hazard pay for 5 days despite the steady rise in Covid-19 cases amongst my coworkers and the skyrocketing rise in Alabama, which currently has 98,301 cases with 1,735 deaths with no sign of slowing down at all. When they took away our hazard pay, I managed to bring the media's attebtion to it. At first, WBRC Fox 6 News only mentioned the number of cases: https://www-wbrc-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.wbrc.com/2020/07/13/employees-state-veterans-home-pell-city-test-positive-covid-/?amp_js_v=a3&amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;outputType=amp&amp;usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#aoh=15969499818386&amp;amp_ct=1596949983727&amp;csi=1&amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wbrc.com%2F2020%2F07%2F13%2Femployees-state-veterans-home-pell-city-test-positive-covid-%2FBut then, CBS 42 reached out to me and was willing to do a story, and I was willing to put my face out there in the hopes of rallying my coworkers together to get our hazard pay back and potentially raise our pay in general. I wanted to demand a union and get us better working conditions and the respect we deserve. I wanted the union to cover House Keeping and Kitchen Staff at my workplace too, not just nurses and CNAS: Employee at Alabama Veteran's Home says ""hero pay"" to workers stoppedhttps://www.cbs42.com/news/local/employee-at-alabama-veterans-home-says-hero-pay-to-workers-stopped/Oh, and they called the hazard pay ""Hero Pay"" and tried to claim it was holiday pay. Here's the screenshot proving thats bullshit: https://throwaway-1236383992761.tumblr.com/post/625949517878116353(Throwaway tumblr bc I hate imgur and I am on mobile and don't feel like clogging my phone up.)Now we have 15 cases of Covid-19 among my coworkers; I had to quarantine 3 or 4 times now, and they only pay you to quarantine once. They got rid of quarantine pay claiming they ran out of money. This facility is privately owned by HMR of Alabama which has multiple other veteran's facilities. They have a contract with the VA to claim they are a state nursing home. Each nursing home makes 87 million dollars a year alone- not to mention money from the insurance gouging they do. The higher ups live in the laps of luxury while my coworkers and I struggle to make ends meet and put food on the table. Many of my coworkers have kids and overwork themselves, sometimes putting as much as a additional 40 to 60 extra hours a week on top of the regular hours. Some of my coworkers work doubles (16 hour shifts) every day or every other day. This is no way to live, I want my coworkers to THRIVE. Not just survive and scrape by. I need advice, and I need you to raise hell. Because this place is gonna keep screwing us over unless I rip the very foundation out from under them. I am not scared of them anymore, I am aware I might lose my job or even my very life. But I am exhausted from the depression and stress this place causes me and my very coworkers. The money they get from the VA should first and foremost go to the veterans and the people who provide care for them! Not the fat cats sitting in their homes, getting fat Christmas bonuses while we might be lucky to get maybe 50 bucks at Christmas time. We are short staffed, so this forced HMR to hire agency CNAS which make 3,000$ a month. I'm lucky to make that in TWO months if I put in a lot of overtime. I need your advice and whatever you can do, LEGALLY, to help us is welcome. If you are a lawyer interested in helping us unionize, hit me up. If you have connections to the media willing to help me get this out there, hit me up. I am counting on you Reddit. I am hoping that this might also help other workers not getting Hazard Pay during this crisis. Wish us luck. (I'm new to reddit, and I need this shared around please)"
"Today my sister had a birthday party for my 6 y/I nephew. It was at a local skate rink,because no other place in our area would host it. The only people wearing masks were my step sister, who is a nurse at a nearby major city, her daughter, my fiancee, and me. Everybody else was strongly anti mask. The staff there didn't wear any ppe while cleaning up people's used cups and plates, and I'm sure they didn't wipe down the tables. We were bunched up in a small private room like cattle in a pen. I was so embarrassed at my family and her friends. Several guest were smokers and highly succeptible to covid. The biggest FU was, that she had my nephew blow out the candles and then served the cake to all the guests. I initially refused to eat any, but I felt pressured to eat and drink. I thought I was an Asshole for holding everyone in contempt for being so irresponsible during a pandemic. Just last week, I saw the same family members eating off each other's plates at another family dinner and holding hands during a meal blessing. Nobody sanitized hands. I regret being there. I just really wanted to be there for my nephew. I rarely see him and he never gets any attention from his mom."
"I live in Michigan. People are having grad parties,proms, going to restaurants and any kind of get together possible. I only see people in masks in grocery stores. No one is ever wearing a mask here. Everyone is having a normal summer no masks, no social distancing, and not trying to stay home the most they can at all. I’ve been home since March. I’ve only left for grocery stores. What is going on? Am I the only one staying home and following precautions? Isn’t there a PANDEMIC? People are getting so sick and dying. Why aren’t people being safe? Does anyone else feel like they are the only ones  staying home and trying to stop the spread?"

"So I’ve seen it on social media but experienced it for the first time at Home Depot and the situation was absolutely disgusting. I was approaching the entrance of Home Depot and as I was entering, I see an older woman that says something to a late 30 something guy that were exiting ( looked like a huge, fat line backer and about 6’6). I could only imagine she was upset that he wasn’t wearing a mask, he was the only one in the store without one. She told him something in a normal tone and all the sudden he got aggressive and started yelling at her, approached her rapidly until he was about 4 feet away. when I saw this happen, I stopped in my tracks. I thought he might attack her but I also didn’t want to intervene prematurely, so I stayed 10 feet back and waited. This a**hole basically “punks” this scared old lady and proceeds to walk away. He then yells back at her “you know what, give me a hug! In a sarcastic tone... he runs back up to her and grabs her for a big hug. She looked freaked out. One, because he can probably murder her with a simple push. 2. This man just hugged her without a damn mask on, which she already was displeased with him not wearing . She didn’t resist as she was probably morbidly shocked. The guy turns around and starts laughing like a damn demon and starts talking real loud so everyone in the parking lot can look. It was super strange and grotesque. Aggressive Anti covid nuts like this need be jailed. Anyone else have a story to share"

But about a complex medical issue they are experts.**This reminds me of the classic Burns line:** ***""Too bad that all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxicabs and cutting hair.""***I think this line is not just about cab drivers and barbers; I think he meant it about people in general. Everyone has an opinion and if you challenge them they will tell you they are entitled to it and maybe cite the First Amendment."
Hey y’all I need advice! So my boyfriend went on a camping trip with his mother and so of their family friends and one of our mutual friends went down and spent the night ( all nine people slept in the camper together) and went out on the boat with them as well. She had just gotten a Covid year for the navy (she was showing no symptoms) and then came back positive. He got tested the day after he saw her and the test came back negative but we are concerned that it was way too early and was also the shallow nostril test. His work wants him to return to work but he’s concerned about being possible positive and spreading it to his coworkers (works retail more specifically delivery). He would prefer to quarantine for 14 days then return but he does have many bills to pay and can’t afford to go without pay for that long. We live in Alabama so I’m not sure what acts or laws can help him with this but we are both scared to possibly expose others. Do y’all have any advice on what he should do. And even if he gets tested again if it’s negative he won’t get paid for the time he’s now missed. We wish we weren’t as concerned about the money but sadly we are and it is a factor in all this madness.
Just saw a report that in the US 33% of people will not get the Covid vaccine once available. With such a large number of people not getting it how big is the risk that the virus could still survive ??

"Back in March I was positively diagnosed with COVID 19 after volunteering with search &amp; rescue and subsequent cleanup efforts after the terrible tornado that ravaged middle TN (Putnam County).After half a month of crazy symptoms that seemed different from day to day, I finally received two negative results and was cleared of the virus.  My brother and mother (whom I infected unknowingly, a really great feeling I might add) survived their bouts with the virus as well although my mother spent two weeks in the hospital.  Fast forward to now, approximately four months later.  Here I sit with yet another positive result and am starting off as another journey into the unknown.   I know what to expect this time but the severity is a concern.I wear a mask everywhere I go in public.  I work from home 80% of the time.  My job requires me to be onsite no fewer than two days a week.   I try to give them the two days but most weeks I only go once.  Last week I went in on a Friday to pack up some of my test gear and put together a prototype assembly that I had redesigned.  Fast forward to Wednesday of this week.  I go back to work to send my prototypes through production testing and discover that the employee that I worked with on Friday had tested positive and was supposedly symptomatic on the Thursday prior to my visit.  I found out late in the day on Wednesday and went to be tested on Thursday morning.  Received a call from the test lab informing me that I have COVID yet again.FML"
"My bestfriend of 16yrs clearly doesn't want to be around me because I'm worried about covid. My father is immune compromised and very high risk, my mother is an age group that puts her at fairly high risk and my sister is mentally handicapped. To say I'm anxious and stressed about what the future looks like would be an understatement. So I got together with my friend after months of quarantine and she acted annoyed because I wouldn't hug her. She was quiet and pretty nonchalant when I expressed my anxiety about contracting Covid and spreading it to family. Later on in the night, she complained about not being able to go to bars because of ""bullshit Covid"" and told me it was really just like the flu. I also found out her boyfriend thinks it's all a hoax to hurt Trump🙄🙄🙄🤦‍♀️Since this get together, she has deleted me off her twitter(likely because I have tweeted things about Covid) and she didn't reply to my last text(about something unrelated to Covid) to her 2 weeks ago. She was my closest friend and I can't even describe how much it hurts to have my legitimate concerns to be blown off, to be ignored and treated like I'm being silly. It seems she wants to throw away our friendship because she wants to stick her head in the sand and pretend this virus doesn't exist. In general, this pandemic has really highlighted how selfish and lacking in empathy people are in this country. I'm becoming increasingly depressed because of it."

"I see the suicide rate going up dramatically due to financial problems -- perhaps this has already happened. I also know the health care system is already becoming over burdened.If many people attempt suicide unsuccessfully or even successfully but at home with the need for police investigation etc. it might be concluded that it would be better if there were facilities (as in the movie Soylent Green or one of Vonnegut's stories) that provided euthanasia as a service.I am frankly in favor of carefully-regulated voluntary euthanasia -- old people who did not want death would have to be protected from families who no longer wanted them around (a tough situation to guard against since they may pressure an aged parent to ""voluntarily"" sign), etc. but speaking for myself, knowing that when the time came that I faced a long painful illness or simply could no longer find work and faced homelessness that I had this out.Ironically, many people are morally opposed to euthanasia while at the same time also opposed to social programs that would help people avoid desperate situations so I know that legalized and easy assisted suicide is perhaps a long way off."
"I’m 19 living with my parents and I’m fairly sure I caught the virus. My dad works at a nursing facility and he tested positive this past week.

I woke up this morning feeling very lethargic and a little achy, but I justified it by me not having slept well last night due to a thunderstorm. I justified the aches because I have been working out so I thought I was just tired and recovering.

"I had a very prophetic and disturbing memory from many years ago. I was  talking to a friend and noted that every generation does things that  the previous generation finds immoral. Just pushing the boundaries. 50's  it was Elvis and parking in cars making out. 60's it was Free Love, 70's  open gay love, and I thought to myself, what is there left? What could  they find that we would find immoral? And I said to my friend jokingly, ""What  are they going to do? Start killing old people?"" I never imagined that  I  would be on this site and another American would comment to me as they  did the other day ""I don't care, It's not MY grandmother"" and a whole cross section of Americans would not even blink. It's  happened. In the last 8 months people in this country have chosen their  freedom to congregate without masks knowing that Seniors and the ill  will die. And it's become an accepted moral choice for them.EDIT; Here is a quote from a post I recently read (Emphasis mine);  ""*So by governments supposedly doing the right thing by having lock downs is the utter most selfish act.* ***They might be protecting the older generation sure, but let's not forget old people aren't the future.""***   Here's a link to the whole post.

"Hello, it all started when my mother came back from work 2 days ago.  She's a nurse and works in assisting living.  When she came back, she seemed fine, and was talking and walking around like normal.  Around 10:00 PM or so, she started complaining of a headache, and asked me to bring her acetaminophen, so I did.  She also told me she lost here sense of smell (but she could smell the next day).  My mother woke up the next day with a sore throat and a heavy feeling in her chest.  This is what worried me the most, because I know that a heavy chest and a sore throat are symptoms of COVID.  She started feeling tired throughout the day, and wanted to nap a lot.  I advised her to eat a lot of foods specifically with Vitamin D, which she agreed to do.  Right now, she still feels the same, but she is feeling cold and tired, so right now she is napping under the covers.  She will be tested tomorrow.  I want some advise on how to handle this situation with someone who might very possibly have COVID?  Are there any over-the-counter meds that might help her more?  Please help."
"So this is just an observation, but many subreddits and fb pages I am a part of have a strict no Covid policy.

"  Now let’s start speaking about the errors and mistakes made in this pandemic, by addressing the flaws in the computer simulation/modelling which have led the governments worldwide to take such drastic actions (at least that’s according to the official story we are told by them) like all-inclusive lockdowns, cyber tracking using apps, mass storing of the genetic data, etc… These proceedings are, honestly, baseless due to the fact they were never used before (i.e.: they are not time-proven) but to make things worse the computer models used for simulation are unrealistic, unreliable and hasty. The true issue though is that most common people and even scientists/experts trust these results blindly.One good example of this is the researcher Neil Ferguson and his massively flawed model; this article tells the whole story: [https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-d](https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/professor-lockdown-modeler-resigns-in-d).Here we have an article discussing the possible mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission: [https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/coronavirus-drifts-through-the-air-in-microscopic-droplets-heres-the-science-of-infectious-aerosols-136663](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/coronavirus-drifts-through-the-air-in-microscopic-droplets-heres-the-science-of-infectious-aerosols-136663); but notice that there is a massive reliance on computer modelling and simulations and this makes a lot of expert analysis/conclusions worthless due to the lack of accuracy and unrealistic parameters used the computer models, add to that the fact of flawed diagnosis process which will, also, affect the models due to the flawed data derived from these tests. Ironically, even these flawed models, indicates that there is a higher risk of infection indoors compared to the outdoors. This let us wonder from where did the all-inclusive lockdown idea came from?This article: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html); is a good example of how flawed researches based on data from suspicious sources widespread at staggering rate. Again, notice that such questionable researches have such a great impact on the decisions made by governments and global organizations without even exerting any effort to check/ensure that these researches are credible. Note that in this article, two researches were withdrawn where one of them was criticizing the usage of ‘Chloroquine’ and ‘HydroxyChloroquine’ and according to the researchers whom withdrew this paper; they said that after second thoughts they have found out that there is no enough evidence on the threats/dangers these drugs might impose. On the other hand, there is another article that was published after the previous one: [https://theconversation.com/why-its-vital-to-look-beyond-the-hype-about-repurposed-malaria-drugs-139153](https://theconversation.com/why-its-vital-to-look-beyond-the-hype-about-repurposed-malaria-drugs-139153); in this article we find a simplified history for these two drugs and some information about their side effects which is very normal since a lot of drugs/medications tend to have such effects. Now, take note that this article is arguing about the potential threats of these side effects, implying that the dangers outweigh the benefits and that these two drugs should not be used in general, but some other experts have refuted and opposed such results and conclusions for multiple reasons using their own research and results. How are we supposed to trust what science and scientists say when the situation is this much floundered and chaotic? Whom do we believe?!!Let us present the following: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19\_drug\_repurposing\_research](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_repurposing_research); of course we have multiple drugs/medications that the scientists are trying to repurpose against the SARS-CoV-2 but it is noticeable that these medications, including ‘Dexamethasone’ which was hailed as a breakthrough, are not as effective as the scientists were expecting. This is because the limited effectiveness of the majority of these medications is not resulting from the direct diathesis/targeting of the virus itself but from the ability to ease the symptoms of the disease. Some of these medications are either anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant which helps in controlling the cytokine storm (we will discuss this later) and the secretions of inflammation which are lethal/deadly in many cases but, on the other hand, some other medications which are used to boost the immune system may create this cytokine storm if they are given inappropriately. Also, some drugs/medications can help in resisting the possibly life-threatening coagulations in the blood, because they are considered as blood thinners, since lethal coagulations can be developed due to the spread of one or multiple types of bacteria which exploit the weakness and preoccupation of the immune system (resisting the viral infection) leading to the formation of deadly clots which, in turn, lead to severe blockage in important blood paths including the heart’s. A big number of cases dying due to heart attacks, caused by certain bacterial infections, are being mistakenly attributed to the virus. To proof the point, we will ask you the following: have you ever took antibiotics (anti-bacterial medications) when you had a common cold (which is caused by different types of viruses) wondering about their effectiveness even though your doctor have prescribed it for you? If you did, now you know the answer; it is to prevent the proliferation of such types of bacteria in order to prevent any harmful damages/symptoms (including blood coagulations) from happening while your body is weak and your immune system is still preoccupied due to the viral infection, that’s why a lot of repurposed drugs and antibiotics or even the antimalarial drug ‘HydroxyChloroquine’ have shown some effectiveness (though this effectiveness is very limited), not because they miraculously cure the COVID-19 disease by targeting it’s causing virus directly but because they might reduce some of the severe impacts/symptoms caused, directly or indirectly, by this disease. Here, we have an article about SARS-CoV-2 and antibiotics and it contains some very important pieces of information which, probably, were not taken into consideration in the development of any computer model/simulation:[https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/antibiotic-treatment-covid-19-complications-could-fuel-resistant-bacteria](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/04/antibiotic-treatment-covid-19-complications-could-fuel-resistant-bacteria).Now let’s shift our focus and talk about the PCR test which have become the most used test for the diagnose of the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the current COVID-19 pandemic, but before going in depth of this topic, here is a basic explanation about the PCR concept: [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/biotech-dna-technology/dna-sequencing-pcr-electrophoresis/a/polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/biotech-dna-technology/dna-sequencing-pcr-electrophoresis/a/polymerase-chain-reaction-pcr); but there are some serious doubts about the effectiveness of PCR tests: [https://www.anti-empire.com/nobody-knows-what-the-supposed-covid-19-test-is-even-testing-for](https://www.anti-empire.com/nobody-knows-what-the-supposed-covid-19-test-is-even-testing-for); In addition, the Tanzanian president (John Magufuli) who holds a doctorate in chemistry, have declared that the PCR tests are severely flawed and this is an article about the details: [https://swarajyamag.com/insta/tanzanian-president-questions-chinese-covid-19-testing-kits-after-samples-from-goat-and-sheep-test-positive](https://swarajyamag.com/insta/tanzanian-president-questions-chinese-covid-19-testing-kits-after-samples-from-goat-and-sheep-test-positive); although there are “question marks” on him and on his background, on the other hand, the tests are quite unreliable because China, the source of a big portion of these tests worldwide, cannot be trusted for various reasons (we will not address this topic now) and add to this the multiple technical and conceptual flaws of the usage of PCR technology as a test. Remember these flawed PCR tests/test kits are used globally for diagnosis where positive results are used to count the numbers of confirmed cases and even are used to count the numbers of the deaths/deceased people but to make things worse we should be reminded that according to these flawed numbers (governments/media use these big numbers as an excuse to their actions), governments worldwide are taking extreme measures such as “useless” lockdowns accompanied by media “terrorism” at least that’s what is publicly being said by officials across the world (we all know that there are hidden agendas where it is useful for them to take such drastic measures but this will not be addressed today) and to top all of this, we have the studies of viral transmission/symptoms, vaccination, serological treatment, other medications and all sorts of related studies/databases/statistics depending to a great extent on the official/public numbers of cases/deaths to draw conclusions about the spread rate, vaccines/treatments effectiveness, etc… but since we already established that these numbers are flawed then these studies, in turn, are flawed.To see a wider picture of this subject, its flaws and the possible deception practiced by governments/global organizations using PCR tests and computer models; we will represent a very “important” article addressing these facts: [https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/](https://uncoverdc.com/2020/04/07/was-the-covid-19-test-meant-to-detect-a-virus/). Shocked!!! You should be since, based on this knowledge, we cannot know for sure who is infected, by what is he infected and all the numbers become useless where the flawed statistics/numbers related to confirmed cases/deaths (according to PCR diagnosis, of course) affect the scientific studies where they, also, become flawed. It’s like using a speedometer to measure the mass and if you find this as useless, irrelevant and extremely stupid approach then so is the usage of the PCR for diagnosis. In addition, based on this article, we can find a major issue in the medical protocols where it is possible that, the continuous changing of protocols associated with differences between protocols worldwide, will create the illusion of an unending widespread of the virus where every couple of months we will seem to witness a new wave this virus in different nations and on the next couple of months we will witness the same thing in other nations. Note that these medical protocols which are related to flawed computer modelling and PCR tests, are issued by global organizations such as WHO, governments, research centers and even universities/colleges worldwide where all of them are, seemingly, making the same mistakes. Should we trust them when they don’t seem to understand anything? Are they blinded to a degree where they can’t see the crystal-clear flaws? Ask yourselves are they stupid, hiding facts from us or just lying to us with a straight face? Whatever is the answer you choose it is bad, right?!! What if they are doing this on purpose to serve certain agendas? After all, with the such an ability to temper with the numbers it could be used to create a second, third and even a tenth wave of the pandemic without the necessity of an actual widespread wave of the causing virus (SARS-CoV-2 in this case) where the mere manipulation of numbers (whether it is on purpose due to hidden agendas or by accident due to a change in protocols used) can create the illusion of a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This segment of this paper, in theory, can debunk all the arguments about the current pandemic since almost all the studies are based on flawed data making them flawed logically but we have earlier (in this paper) considered them true just to demonstrate the different problems in the official narrative of the governments/international organizations, and we will continue to consider/use these numbers as if they are accurate, only to present other problems with the official narrative which is sold to us by the mainstream media as solid facts.One such a problem is concerning the serological tests that are used to detect antibodies; in some nations, governments/organizations have used such tests to diagnose the COVID-19 disease by considering that the presence of antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 is an indication of an active infection at that very moment and this have led to an increased inflation in the numbers of confirmed cases but, of course, this is scientifically wrong because the antibodies might be produced in response to a previous infection or contact with the this virus where the person have recovered a certain time ago before he was tested. These antibodies keep circulating in the blood stream providing protection/immunity for an unknown interval of time where they could still be detectable even if the individual has recovered early on and now is uninfected. In addition, there are some doubts about an earlier spread of this virus since August of last year (2019): [https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-wuhan-in-august-study-suggests](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/coronavirus-may-have-been-in-wuhan-in-august-study-suggests); theoretically, the time interval between August and December (it is the month in which the official public declaration of the SARS-CoV-2 took place) is about 3 months (4 months if we count the last half of August and the first half of December). This significant period of time is more than enough for this virus to circulate the entire globe and that might explain the immunity, even if limited, possessed by many all around the world even though they didn’t made contact with virus officially, whether it be directly or indirectly. Of course, serological tests are important to “measure” the level of herd immunity in a particular community but to use such tests alone, without other specific types of viral tests, to diagnose the possibly infected individuals is a mistake to say the least. Also, the precise usage of these tests, periodically and regularly, should in concept give the scientists an idea about the duration of the acquired immunity and its effectiveness which is significant since it might refute many false allegations/theories/assumptions about this pandemic made by governments, organizations and experts/scientists. Put in mind that the official narrative was rashly and suspiciously, without enough scientific proof/evidence, presented to the public where the governments with the ‘blessing’ of multiple international organizations started imposing procedures never used in the past; then, after the imposition of such measures, experts started studying the effectiveness of these measures which is ‘insane’ to be honest. Why did they firmly impose such measures without prior knowledge of their efficacy and the possible outcomes? How did they force these procedures with the decision to study their efficiency afterwards? If they didn’t know the effectiveness of these measures, in the first place, why did they impose such proceedings on a global scale that brought ruins/hardships to so many nations/individuals with such insistence? Are they this desperate to convince us with their flawed official narrative to a degree where they had to use flawed science to justify such irrational measures being taken? I will let you answer those questions for yourselves.Here we will talk about antibody treatment by presenting the following: [https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-treatment/](https://www.wired.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-antibody-treatment/); the problems start from the limited quantities to the appropriate dosage, these issues require from the scientists reliable solutions. The experts have found out that manufacturing these antibodies artificially/synthetically in laboratories might solve multiple issues but this, in turn, leading us to the issue of uncertainty regarding the efficiency of these antibodies where the antibodies might work in labs, on animals and on people in human trials but these experiments don’t necessarily mean that this treatment will work on a real-life scenario. In addition, the antibodies treatment can, possibly, lead to a severe and dangerous immune response known as a cytokine storm; this aggressive response is what, generally, lead to most deaths in cases of viral infections. Also, note that this cytokine storm may result from the virus itself, medical drugs or even from a vaccine (it is not developed yet) and this is an article to help you understand the concept in a better way: [https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/](https://www.newscientist.com/term/cytokine-storm/); we, also, noticed from our research that there are doubts on the pace of development of these antibody treatments and on the pace of serum manufacturing where it could take many years before a completed treatment is finalized. Now we will talk about vaccines not only traditional ones but also other types of vaccines by presenting the following: [https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-a-new-type-of-vaccine-using-rna-could-help-defeat-covid-19-133217](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-a-new-type-of-vaccine-using-rna-could-help-defeat-covid-19-133217); take note that, all the researches about these “new” vaccines are nothing but ‘unproven’ laboratory experiments though these researches are being developed for 20 years and since such ‘work’ is not experimented/used in real life scenarios yet, the insurance of safety and production of these vaccines could, alone, require additional years of work. If a mistake occurs because of urgency (in case the argument was that this emergency situation of the pandemic requires swift actions) the outcomes might be catastrophic where the effects/results of these vaccines, composed of molecular instructions that is the synthetic mRNA of the virus; could backfire if the hastily produced/deployed vaccines where incomplete, contaminated or even contained errors regarding the genetic sequence of the mRNA. In addition, we have to highlight that the average time needed to develop the common/traditional vaccines is around 16 years; a good example is the SARS-CoV-1 virus which was discovered 18 years ago, yet to this very day the scientific community has not developed a vaccine for this virus. Scientists claim that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is more dangerous, complicated and infectious than the Previous virus, so how much time is needed to develop a safe and effective vaccine? Should we wait around 20 years whilst being quarantined, fed with lies and imaginary procedures until a vaccine is developed?"
"While information pertaining to different modes of virus transmission has become increasingly prevalent across social media, there is often confusion between ballistic transmission and aerosol transmission. **Ballistic transmission** refers to droplets dispelled from the body of one person to another in a projectile-like motion. These particles are much smaller than aerosols because other airborne molecules do not have time to bind to them before they reach another person's face. Examples of scenarios during which this occurs include coughing, sneezing, speaking, singing, etc. This mode of transmission is most commonly talked about and many people believe this to be the only reason to wear a mask in public.**Aerosols** are solids or liquids suspended in the air. They can be visible (like mist) or invisible (like dust). These particles are much larger than ballistic particles due to the countless other molecules suspended in the air alongside particles containing a virus. One aerosol may contain millions of other molecules in addition to the virus and can be suspended in the air for over an hour.Because aerosols are airborne, virus transmission is far more probable inside enclosed buildings than outdoors. For this reason, proper facility ventilation is essential to slow the spread of the virus. Poorly-ventilated facilities, such as prisons, detention centers, and old buildings are examples of areas that tend to house more airborne aerosols.  If a gathering is absolutely necessary, the optimal place for it to occur is outdoors with masks and social distancing.&amp;#x200B;https://preview.redd.it/qihzc2spzdi51.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a9a8006871bdd2e2c7da8c03d5d0d3e8376ba5dfTopic Source: Dr. Jose Jimenez, University of Colorado, BoulderText Source:  [https://www.uchealth.org/today/covid-19-and-airborne-aerosols-what-you-need-to-know/](https://www.uchealth.org/today/covid-19-and-airborne-aerosols-what-you-need-to-know/) Image Source:  [https://theconversation.com/open-windows-to-help-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-advises-architectural-engineer-142579](https://theconversation.com/open-windows-to-help-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-advises-architectural-engineer-142579)"
I am scheduled to work on Tuesday.  If I don't get results back by then should I stay home?
"I (16 M) have been having massive diarrhea for the last 24 hours. After the first big dump 💩 last night I felt fatigued and went to bed early. Today I felt better energy-wise, but my diarrhea is still going on. I don’t think it’s food poisoning, because I’ve pretty much been eating the same stuff as my mom (45 F) and she’s been fine.I’ve heard that diarrhea and fatigue are potential early symptoms of Covid. I know that I might not necessarily have it, but I want to know how does Covid usually progress? This way I can keep an eye out in case I get worse and need to self-isolate/get tested.UPDATE: As of this morning (36 hours of symptoms  now) I am still nauseous, and feel like I might need to be on the toilet again at any moment. I’ve never had diarrhea last this long. Also, I have a headache, but then again, I just woke up. So I’m going to wait and see if that goes away. No signs of fever, chills, or cough yet, so I’m looking to see if this could be stomach flu or a gastrointestinal disease maybe...UPDATE 2: I now have chills 🥶 😩 , still no fever or  cough"
"My friend just went to Tennessee. During a pandemic. Came back and didn't quarentine. She now has a family from out of state visiting, less than a week later, and is angry because I don't think we should be hanging out because everyone has traveled and no one has quarentined for any sort of time. My wife is mad because I said it's irresponsible and we shouldn't be going to visit these people.We live in Oklahoma. Feel free to look at our abysmal covid numbers."
Appreciate your thoughts
This may seem like a stupid question being that corona is quite new. I consider myself a long-hauler and still experience symptoms. Does anyone seem to have symptoms that get better or go away? I wonder if this is something I’ll have to deal with for the rest of my life.
"I have 50/50 custody with my ex of our 3 kids and we exchange each Sunday evening, this last Sunday I dropped off the kids and she told me the next day “I have covid and got my positive test back” I immediately had a number of questionsThe first beingWtf did you not say anything before taking the kids ?When did you know?Who else have you exposed ?Basic thingsShe told me that she felt sick the week prior but didn’t test until some of her family tested positive 😬So, last week you had your family get sick, test positive and then you decide after getting the kids to disclose you were exposed to them??Now, this is where it gets sad and maddening I said, please bring them over and I’ll take them, they may not have it as transmission rates are pretty low.  She responded, “don’t you understand! I have covid só they’ve been exposed !!” And refused to drop them off with me. Instead she went to her family’s covid party with other adults who had tested positive and other kids (all going back to school this week) who hadn’t been tested.  My kids test result came back 2 days later and 2/3 of them tested negative.  Even after their covid party !! Again I pleaded, drop them off, our son has a pre existing lung condition and could be bad but most important get them out of the cesspool of morons who think it’s ok to fraternize together and spread it around. Again refused to drop them off and this is after the state calls and tells her and me that we need to quarantine for 2 weeks.  My kids call and while talking about their day say“Moms boyfriend was over here hanging out” and then I roll over in my grave, what is going on?? How are you exposing this to him ? Do you just not care ??This chap, goes to work the next day AND has his kids who he takes to the community rec center pool !!!To top this house of horrors off, I picked up my kids yesterday and they said“We have been up at our grandparents house with all our other cousins for a back to school party”Doubling down on the covid party and infecting as many as possible. My lord, I personally am a healthy male and don’t overly concern myself of the virus effecting me badly, but I can’t stand knowing that there are people out there like this with blatant disregard for basic civil duty and responsibility."
"I went back to in person (unfortunately) classes yesterday and since I've been experiencing more present chest pains. My anxiety has beem increased lately so I can't tell if it is from this increased anxiety or may be a symptom of COVID. I'm not experiencing any other symptoms and very little shortness of breath (usually followed by activity or any kind of heightened stress), but my anxiety keeps telling me I definitely have COVID. Has chest pain been the predominant/only symptom for anyone else? (Note: i also recently was diagnosed with esophagilitis due to a gastric reflux issue that was also causing chest pains. I forgot to take my meds for about 2 days, but have been back on them regularly for about 3 days now)I'm planning on getting tested as early as I can tomorrow."
"Life has been turned upside down on its head for all of us since Covid became national headline news back in March, it is slowly getting back to normal, very slowly. I work for a grocery store chain, and every manufacturer of all the brands you see in the store is having trouble with either keeping up on production, transporting their product, getting the resources they need to be able to make whatever it is they make. There at least 1000 long term out of stock items in my chain, Giant on the east coast US. Please do not call me a hero, because that is not what this is about, if the media has guilted you into believing grocery store employees are special then call corporate and tell them to give us full time and stop this army of part timers bs. Although I am personally lucky and get a lot of hours because I can work in 5 different departments and can work as much as i want to pretty much. Anyway, moving on, how has Covid affected you general public, is your life getting back to any way it was before Covid, do you still have a job, is everyone you know and your family  is everyone ok and safe? I would love to hear your story as much as you want to share. I love you all and wish everyone well."

"Hi, I’m an 18 year old female I was diagnosed with COVID-19 06/23/2020 but had it about 2 days prior to testing. To make this shorter I’ll just list my initial symptoms *I’m adding a conclusion to each day for those who don’t want to read in depth* Day One 06/21/2020- no symptoms, slight fatigue (contracted it from my boyfriend 2 days before)•06/21/2020 Conclusion: no plausible symptomsDay Two 06/22/2020- very fatigued, unable to stay concentrated fever of 99.7 (low grade) slight congestion (comparable to allergies) no coughing •06/22/2020 Conclusion: no plausible symptoms other than a low grade feverDay Three 06/23/2020- felt fine with little congestion, slight runny nose, got tested that day, no coughing, no fever •06/23/2020 Conclusion: no plausible symptomsDay Four 06/24/2020- slept 14 hours, woke up and had to force myself to eat (it took everything in me to microwave a hot pocket) I ate then went straight to bed slept for 17 hours, no coughing, no fever •06/24/2020 Conclusion: extreme fatigue and lack of energyDay Five 06/25/2020- woke up feeling refreshed and energized no congestion, felt completely fine and started cleaning the house, no fever, no cough, at this point I was positive I didn’t have COVID-19 but then I received a call giving me my positive results a few hours later. •06/25/2020 Conclusion: no plausible symptoms Day Six 06/26/2020- slightly congested, honestly still felt like allergies, no fever, no coughing, I made enchiladas for dinner and I noticed they didn’t taste as strong•06/26/2020 Conclusion: slight (small) difference of taste/smell. Day Seven 06/27/2020- still felt like allergies, still no coughing, and no fever. I made myself ramen noodles and noticed I couldn’t taste it smell them at all. (I tried smelling my favorite perfume- still nothing, so I went through my entire collection of perfume 40+ bottles of all different fragrances as I frantically sprayed them throughout the room, I couldn’t smell a single one. I moved on to my body wash and shampoo/conditioner- still nothing, I did laundry and even added a ton of scent beads- still. Nothing.) I cleaned the house with bleach- still. nothing. So in desperation I took a deep sniff of straight undiluted bleach: Nothing. At. All. •06/27/2020 Conclusion: I completely lost all sense of smell and taste.After day 7 the only symptoms I had were loss of taste/smell, slight fatigue and drainageThe whole time I had Covid-19 I had no breathing issues other than slight shortness of breath, only when I was talking an excessive amount, my blood oxygen levels never dropped below 98 (Regular 99-100), never coughed once, only had a low grade fever, I basically had no plausible symptoms what so ever. After the first week-•I lost my sense of smell/taste for about 3 weeks •My smell/taste came back around late July •As my smell/taste was coming back my nasal cavities burned so bad, kinda like getting water in your nose but 10x worse. •Once It came back it was only 30% of what it use to be. But food tasted/smelled the same (just not as strong). Flash forward to now, my smell is probably at 60%-65% and my taste is god awful I can’t even give a percentage because i can’t taste the same “natural taste” of foods I ate previously to Covid-19, they all taste different and disgusting (probably makes no sense to people who aren’t experiencing this) sometimes if I exhale through my nose while chewing I get a hint of the natural flavor for half a second. For the past two weeks foods have tasted absolutely horrible especially meats. They taste rotten/spoiled, absolutely repulsive and smell disgusting, anything that’s classified as “regular food” tastes and smells rancid, which is odd because all my fragrances smell the same as they use to (prior to COVID-19) the scents just not as strong)Sweet things are doable- cookies, pancakes, icecream, chocolate etc. tasted somewhat the same up until yesterday sweets tasted normal, but now they’re starting to taste rotten as well. •The only thing that doesn’t taste absolutely putrid is cheese (weird right?) any type of cheese; cheddar, Colby jack, mozzarella, pepper jack, you name it tastes fine; it barely has a taste but I can still sense the underlying flavors with no disruption of the smell or natural taste. •Candy also tastes the same•EVEN MY TOOTHPASTE IS STARTING TO TASTE RANCID !!!It’s getting so bad that I can barely eat anything and I try to ignore the activity completely, I went from 129lbs prior to COVID-19 to 113lbs currently (I haven’t weighed this little since I was around 13). Eating has become a burden and gets worse*** day by day, I’ve tried researching but it came to no avail because COVID-19 is relatively new. All I know is this sucks, I’d rather have no taste/smell at all than to deal with everything edible tasting/smelling putrid. (Before someone asks, I have perfect dental hygiene, no cavities, no build up, I floss, I brush, and I use mouthwash twice a day if not three times a day) Anyone else experiencing this?"
"Most well-intentioned people try to help the homeless by donating their time, money, and food to homeless shelters. While helping the homeless like this is great, it’s not enough. For instance, COVID19 has caused a 17% increase in homelessness in my city, and there are simply not enough shelter beds to go around. We could allocate funds to build more shelters, but that’s basically like putting a very expensive bandaid over a gaping wound. It might help for a little while, but the problem will soon grow out of control again. In order to make sure homelessness doesn’t increase beyond shelter capacity the next time there is a pandemic or global crisis, we must invest in other solutions and nip the problem in the bud.The best technique to solve homelessness is PREVENTION. Preventative techniques are both cost effective and equitable. The easiest way to make sure someone doesn’t end up on the streets knocking at a homeless shelter’s door is to help them not get evicted in the first place. This entails helping these individuals with rent and utility bills, assisting them in finding more affordable housing, counseling them, and helping with legal fees. This may sound expensive, but investing in prevention saves millions of dollars in shelter costs alone, such that $14 dollars is saved for every $1 invested.When this type of preventative program was enacted in the U.S. in 2009 through the Homelessness Prevention and Rapid Re-Housing Program, it resulted in nearly 90% of the program participants being placed in permanent homes. Unfortunately, the program was ended after 3 successful years. Perhaps if a prevention program like it still existed in time for the COVID19 pandemic, not as many people would be faced with housing insecurity.Bottom line: COVID19 has greatly exacerbated the homelessness crisis. In addition to donating your time and money to shelters, you can also help the homeless by voting for local and federal candidates that prioritize homelessness prevention programs!Sources: \-- Lecture given by Dr. Patrick J. Fowler at Washington University in St. Louis\-- [http://www.evidenceonhomelessness.com/factsheet/hprp/](http://www.evidenceonhomelessness.com/factsheet/hprp/)"
"Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve had covid symptoms starting in late April and since then I seem to recover since then. I work from home and get groceries delivered. Currently living on my own with the exception of my dad. We tend to distant ourselves even within the home. My question is I’ve noticed that my symptoms seem to exacerbate whenever I’m in close contact with someone even if it’s for a minute. Whenever I’ve gone for medical appointments or had someone at the home (dads family friend who did not wear a mask; I did not know he was coming by but kind of stayed out of the way although he spoke with me for about 2 min; we were all outside), symptoms tend to flare up (blocked sinus, rise in body temperature, general malaise. Has anyone else experienced this?"
"So I got tested for COVID about two weeks and two days ago, and it came back positive. I had symptoms three days before I got tested. I’ve felt fine for a week, and then all of a sudden two days ago I got 99.4 temp, chills and sweats, nausea, and a sore throat. Now i’m sneezing some and I still have chills and a sore throat. It’s all mild, but I’m just concerned because i’m supposed to start school in two days. I was supposed to go back to work yesterday, but I called out because I was very nauseous and cold. My mom thinks I should just go to school because I should have already recovered from COVID according to her. I just don’t know what to do because no one knows much about this virus. I don’t want to infect other people. I just want to be well and live my normal life. Does anyone have any advice? I know this is reddit and not a doctor, but I don’t really have the money to go to the doctor again. And even if I do and get tested again, it will probably be positive because you can test positive for 90 days after you recover even if you aren’t sick anymore. I’m just so fed up with not feeling well. And what sucks is that it’s hard for people to believe me because it’s so mild and people think i’m overreacting. I just don’t want to spread this stuff around and feel awful at school!! I’ve already missed two weeks of school because of this."
today is fucked. i found out my best friend that i played minecraft with is dead because of covid. he went dark at 2016. we played minecraft during my childhood. i invited him to a party today because why not. it was his little brother that answered. when i aked about his brother he broke down crying. he said that he passed because of covid. i started to break down a little bit. he was a big part of my childhood. we were so close to beating the ender dragon too. i never found out why he went dark. i turned off my xbox right away. and went to my room and cried for 30 minutes. im too scared to get back on my xbox. i will never forget you Haloboss73. you will always be in my heart.
"My dad has been lost to the conspiracy theories since nearly the beginning, but my mother was always extremely cautious. Today she told me that Covid would disappear after the election and that the media is making it worse than it is😔 Now they are both out running around everywhere, going out to eat, etc. I can't believe the 180 turn in my mother's opinion about Covid. Just last week she was taking it seriously. It's like invasion of the body snatchers.I'm so fucking angry that our government is pretending this doesn't exist and that there is no danger. I may very well lose one or both of my parents."
"So I live in Wyoming and the culture here tends to be that things that happen in the rest of the country don't happen here. Which, to be fair we don't have very high infection rates, like in my town we haven't had any deaths, and there's only been 37 deaths in the whole state as of right now. But that's still 37 most likely preventable deaths if any precautions were taken! Wearing a mask gets you stared at, Walmart and Safeway ""require"" masks now but half the ppl there aren't wearing them (which at least is better than before the requirement when maybe 1/4 of ppl there were). At the dentist I was going to, the receptionist sitting across from me took off her mask half way through explaining the paperwork because ""it was so hard to talk with it"". The dentists and nurses didn't wear a mask unless they were actually working on you. My friend went to a car race and show, and a concert yesterday. It didn't look like she was wearing a mask. My other friend was going on dates with several different people to different resteraunts and hooking up. I quit my job because no one wore masks there except me and we work in a very small space with less than a foot between us, and work directly with the public and items from the public. The bosses weren't letting people go home when they didn't feel well.The other people in my college department are mad about how they can't go to online classes, and gather at one guys house to do class work every night, they started doing this the night after he flew across the country and drove through Denver.Am I wrong to find this distressing? Is staying at home all the time and only being in public to go to the pharmacy, and wearing a mask every single time I leave the house being overly cautious? Should I continue to encourage my friends to do the same, and keep cutting off those who don't? I feel like I know the answers, but it feels like every single person around me is passively telling me I'm overreacting."
I was diagnosed covid positive 10 days ago.   The symptoms won’t go away.  I am cold the hot.  It hurts to breathe and if I attempt anything I start hacking and having cold sweets.   I’m expected to be at work tomorrow.    I don’t know what to do.  I need my job desperately.   But I can’t function.    I work as a landscaper so it physically exhausting anyway.   I hat this.  No one is telling me when will I improve.
My husbands family are having a backyard get together with approximately 20 adults and at least 4 children. I’m VERY conflicted. Is it too soon for this kind of get together? Am I being over paranoid?Edit: I live in a Big Canadian City
"Hello,So this sucks. My fiancé and I were exposed last Tuesday to COVID-19. Our results came back, not detected. Yay! Well, my fiancée started to display symptoms identical to those of COVID-19 on Saturday and has only gotten worse. Today, his work called and told him he needed to come in despite these symptoms. Is this okay to do? I’m livid, but I’m also biased and just want to keep him safe.I wasn’t sure if we should go have another test or not.Thanks,MW"

"I have a friend, in the US, who's facing a $10,000+ medical bill because her illness was not coded as COVID-related.  I'm not sure of the exact timeline but, after her husband went on a long plane trip,- she had upper respiratory symptoms and negative nasal swab back in March (I'm not sure exactly which test)- then she lost sense of taste and smell and had a number of other symptoms that are common in confirmed COVID-19 patients- and then she had a negative antibody test (again, not sure exactly which one).I'm under the impression that of those three things, the loss of taste and smell is likely to be by far the most diagnostic.  Currently looking for literature to support or refute that idea.Has anyone else faced this and succeeded in getting a doctor to change the code?  Any tips or thoughts?  Thank you for reading."
Have noticed this is a very strong pattern in people I've met and cannot seem to find any answers except that it is an easy place to scratch.

(2). **22 October 2020**: the results of the first and only randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of mask wearing against COVID-19 for the general population are in. The study took place in Denmark, with Professor Thomas Lars Benfield as one of the principal investigator. When asked via email when the study will be fully published, he replied ""[As soon as a journal is brave enough to accept the paper](https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1317875526997102594/photo/1)"". Given the current climate of censorship, this reply strongly suggests that masks were found to be either ineffective or actively harmful/counter-productive. A corroborating media [source](https://www.azerbaycan24.com/en/comprehensive-covid-19-mask-study-rejected-by-journals-because-no-one-is-brave-enough-to-publish-results-danish-researchers-say/) noted: &gt;The Lancet, the New England Journal of Medicine, and the American Medical Association Journal all turned down the paper, Danish media reported...The study, which began in late April, involved 6,000 Danes, half of whom were asked to wear masks at all times in public places. The other half were selected as a control group and were instructed not to cover their faces. After a month, participants were tested for Covid-19 as well as for antibodies against the virus. The study’s researchers have remained tight-lipped about their findings, but they’ve dropped plenty of clues that suggest **it was the paper’s conclusion, not its methodology, that led to the journals’ rejections**.(3). At least four leading COVID-19 scholars - Jay Bhattacharya, John Ioannidis, Gabriela Gomes, and Sunetra Gupta - have recently gone public complaining that academic papers of theirs with findings that challenge the narrative have been blocked unfairly in the peer-review process with the justification that if they were to be published, the public would get too relaxed about COVID-19. I suspect that [same fate is shared by any manuscript that would dare to suggest that masks are ineffective - blocked for fear of the potential harm it may cause](https://old.reddit.com/r/NoNewNormal/comments/jdo8ax/results_of_the_first_and_only_randomized/) (""it has to be held to a higher standard of evidence"" - in other words, double standards galore: if the result supports the narrative, low standards required; if the result doesn't, reject because ""it's better to be safe than sorry""...).- Gabriela Gomes, ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=st_yj34AAAAJ&amp;hl=en)),  https://twitter.com/mgmgomes1/status/1291162358962937857?s=20&gt;Some relevant knowledge is not being communicated widely because science journals refuse to publish it. Our most recent preprint estimating relatively low herd immunity thresholds has just been rejected. The top reason was:&gt;&gt;Given the implications for public health, it is appropriate to hold claims around the herd immunity threshold to a very high evidence bar, as these would be interpreted to justify relaxation of interventions, potentially placing people at risk.- John Ioannidis, ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JiiMY_wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao)), at end of [interview](https://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2020/07/09/a-conversation-with-john-ioannidis/): &gt;But the outrage propagated by social media is a force of its own, and destroys any intelligent discourse, civil or uncivil. Once the outrage gets going, platforms for academic discourse censor and the discourse just doesn’t happen. I was unable to publish my essay about nosocomial spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes and hospitals. I submitted to many outlets. I suspect the editors feared social media backlash against my raising an uncomfortable issue. Fear isn’t healthy for science.- Sunetra Gupta, ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mIvvUnoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao)), in [interview](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/londoners-diary/the-londoner-let-children-be-exposed-to-viruses-says-professor-gupta-a4538386.html): &gt;But Professor Gupta also revealed the toll of her different approach. “We’ve found it difficult to publish our work in mainstream journals,” she said, adding “sadly anything that deviates from the consensus has been met with criticism – not simply of the science, but we’ve been labelled as saying things that are dangerous.”- Jay Bhattacharya, ([profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2wH43aAAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao)), in [interview](https://zdoggmd.com/jay-bhattacharya/): &gt;But I think the knee jerk reaction to censor people that you disagree with inside the scientific community has been absolutely terrible. One of my Stanford colleagues actually wrote a New York Times article arguing for essentially a censorship board for our articles in Nova Science...It was absolutely shocking to me. I feel like my academic freedom was attacked and I’ve been at the university for 30 plus years actually the motto of the university is “Let The Winds of Freedom Blow.”All these insights from insiders of the scientific system may give a very different texture to the social media advice ""Listen to the experts"". In order for us to listen, they first must be able to speak."
"Throwaway account as we're concerned about job security...My spouse is a teacher at Thurgood Marshall middle school in St Petersburg, Florida. We are upset by the pathetic excuse of provided PPE and other protections, expired sanitizer, recalled sanitizer, and absolutely no effort to clean or sanitize classrooms or community spaces. My spouse has intentionally left things position in order to tell if the cleaning staff has been through the room. They have not.They are utterly failing to follow through with ANY of their claims about how this will be handled safely.Direct quote from principal Nicole Wilson yesterday, at an emergency staff meeting. She was made to say this to her staff after being refused additional personnel by the county:""Up until an hour ago all of you were going to be quarantined for 14 days until September 18th,  but 80 people have been exposed and the district decided that is too many people to quarantine.""They are doing nothing.

"A few days ago my boyfriend tested positive for the virus. He doesn't seem concerned in the slightest and says it's not a big deal, probably because he's young, but I'm extremely scared.

"The misconception I hear over and over about masks is they are somehow supposed to keep you from getting covid. This is simply not the case, in fact due to touching your face more often to adjust the mask (unconsciously most of the time) a mask actually slightly increases your chance to catch covid. The reason everyone needs to wear masks is simple, you do not always know when you are sick, in fact with covid you are likely spreading it for a week before you show your first symptoms. The mask keeps you from spreading to others, because you are not breathing, coughing, and sneezing all over everything you are near. This keeps the virus contained to yourself (as best as can be under the circumstances.) In turn those around you that are wearing masks are much less.likely to make you sick. Do you know if Joe or Bob shopping in the isle just ahead of you have covid? Neither do they! Its the same concept as herd immunity, the more those of us that are healthy wear a mask the less chance that somone who isn't will catch it. It isn't about you getting it or not,  It about you having the respect and courtesy for others to not take the chance of spreading it to them. Be kind to your neighbors and wear your mask."

"Hello,I'm interviewing a 'COVID Denier' next week and thought I would ask the people of Reddit for some advice/guidance when approaching this topic. Upon asking him to elaborate on his claims he responded with this:&amp;#x200B;&gt;*'Thanks for your message. Put it this way it wasn’t a quick process of watching a couple of videos etc. I’ve spent well over 1000 hours listening to 100s of different doctors and scientists, and reading documents etc. So today I can tell you or anyone else without any doubt it doesn’t exist (at least not as a virus that spreads from person to person) But they are poisoning us using many methods to help their case for forcing lockdowns which is only an excuse to crash the economy and force control and vaccines onto us all.  It’s been planned for many years. Even the name Covid as the name of the virus was known at least 20 years ago.   All UN countries agreed to agenda 21 in 1992, Bush, Major and other world leaders. What we’re witnessing today is just their way of pushing it faster to completely take away our rights. But the future they have planned is much worse.   Anyway you don’t need to fear a disease, but you should fear their vaccines and their lockdowns'*&amp;#x200B;I would appreciate your thoughts on the best way to counter his opinion as he is clearly going to have far more experience fighting this battle than I do.&amp;#x200B;Thanks in advance."
"Dr. Ali Ellebedy was kind enough to give a webinar at my university regarding his most recent SARS-Cov-2 vaccine research that was published. His research group found that an antibody called 2B04 potently neutralizes the virus that causes COVID-19 in mice. Next, they plan to repeat the study with golden hamsters, because previously cited studies have found that the COVID-19 manifests itself similarly in hamsters compared to humans. With around 170 preclinical vaccines in the works around the globe, this finding is quite promising. &amp;#x200B;Source:  [https://www.jimmunol.org/content/205/4/915](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/205/4/915)"

"I work at a trade school (kind of) in Chicago. More than half of my coworkers will take their masks off to talk, yell, or cause they can't breathe. Same thing with students. They also wear it below their noses. I feel like I was forced into this job from my mom to be honest. She doesn't understand. She should be more worried than me because she has several health issues. As well as my older relatives I live with. I also work with a family member, so I feel like if I quit or something whe won't like me. One of the staff went to florida, and in chicago I think that's one of the states that requires quarnetine for two weeks. But he is working right now and hasn't quarantined. I regret quitting my job. I'd rather take verbal abuse at my old job than work with assholes who don't wear masks. Sure they take their temperatures everyday when they come in but is that even enough. My friend works at a hospital and she had COVID and she was fine. If I get it I know theres nothing I can do. I just know that I do not want to get it and end up getting hospitalized for some reason. I'm the receptionist there so it's kind of hard to keep my distance. Any advice ?"
"News from 《thedailybeast》.President Donald Trump’s advisers warned him as early as late January that the coronavirus pandemic, then taking root in China, could cost countless lives in America.Despite this stark warning, revealed by Bob Woodward in his new book Rage and first reported by CNN, Trump downplayed the pandemic—the exact opposite of what any responsible leader should do, experts told The Daily Beast.As a result, tens of thousands of Americans have died unnecessarily, the same experts said. “This will be case study for decades to come in schools of health for how things can go wrong,” Anthony Alberg, a University of South Carolina epidemiologist, told The Daily Beast.  “He has blood on his hands,” added Irwin Redlener, the founding director of Columbia University’s National Center for Disaster Preparedness and a former adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden."
"\[UPDATE\]: I confronted her: I told her she should quarantine like our former roommate did to be safe and to be not get fined. She said she didn't give her info at the airport for that reason.&amp;#x200B;Hi everyone,I need some help with a roommate who doesn’t seem to be taking Covid as seriously as I am.We live in NYC where Covid was pretty serious in the spring. During this time, she went back and forth between our apartment and her boyfriend's, which seemed a little risky but she assured me both of them were socially distancing. It turned into hanging out and eating out with different people.Last week, she went on a weeklong vacation to SoCal and hung out in SD and LA with friends and family.Since she got back, she hasn’t been quarantining for 14 days, which is the rule of thumb here and now mandatory for incoming travelers too. Yesterday, I told her to ""maybe stay inside post-travel"" but she is still going out.Should I confront her or am I making it a bigger issue than it is?"

"Hi my friend tested positive for COVID-19 and I have been around them in close contact for several days prior to knowing.I got tested ASAP and it came back negative but I am having weird symptoms. I got tested at a clinic and my job requires that we quarantine and not come to work if we have been exposed! I work in healthcare. In order for me to get paid they expect a short term disability form to be filled out by the physician in the clinic. However, the clinic called and said the physician won’t fill it out because I tested negative. Even though CDC says symptoms etc can appear from 2-14 days after exposure. I need to still be able to pay bills, I would hate to develop symptoms and put others lives at risk by going to work because the clinic won’t fill out the form, but I really need the money.Is there anyway I can report this to the state? I’m sure there are people going through the same thing and they risk putting other people’s lives at risk because they still need money for bills yet physicians won’t fill out their forms to be able to get paid. Any advice?"
"Looking at Worldometer, China seems to have had less than 5,000 cases since the middle of March and only 2 deaths since April 17th.I understand that it's difficult to trust anything that comes out of China. But if these numbers even vaguely represent reality, what's actually going on there? Those case figures are only slightly higher than Hong Kong and just over twice as many as New Zealand (a comparatively tiny island country that's had strict quarantine and clamped down hard on every outbreak), and less deaths than either."
"My sister is away at college And is really sick and if she has Covid is planning on coming home and quarantining herself instead of quarantining herself at the college like everybody else at the college is doing who has Covid. I work in the food industryam I even allowed to go to workbecausethere's only one bathroom with a showerthe chance of her not leaving her room at allis very lowand even if I'm constantly cleaning the house the chances of me passing on Covid have to be enough that it is a problem...Even though I don't have Covid if she comes home I'm assuming that me working in the food industry is gonna be done at that point until there's no chance of me having Covid, am I correct?"

What’s the difference? (Aside from the time it takes to get the results.) How are they each administered? If she tests negative on the rapid test does can she go back to school today or does she have to wait to get the PCR test? If so why don’t they just do a PCR test?!

No Temperature or cough just the loss of the senses. Do you think it is Covid? or just a sinus infection or something? I should add that someone i was in vacinity of last week has also just told me she cannot taste or smell . I have tried booking a test but all day I have had no luck. Any advice on how to get a test booked ? refreshed the page about 100000 times today. I am in the UK. &amp;#x200B;Let me know your thoughts, I  would appreciate it !"
"Before anyone says anything about ""if you don't like it then leave"" or ""what makes you think any country is better""  I have a right to an opinion. Schools should not have been opened back up. And I know people are thinking ""oh only so many will die"" would you say that if you had a child? Are are you a garbage human being who doesn't give a crap about yourself or others well being? If I had a child I would not want them in school right now. ""Oh but my child needs the social interactions. "" I would rather my child live after this then put them at risk. They can build bonds when this is done. ""Oh it's just like the flu"" does the flu cause scarring on organs? Or neurological issues ? Does the flue damage the heart and lungs? EXACTLY. I hate that the U.S is full of selfish people. Selfish politicians who treat the country like a business. If I could leave the country believe me I would."

"Wondering if I’m the only one? I’ve been struggling with my mental health before Covid, but since this all started it’s been so much worse. I have chronic sinus issues, (post nasal drip), and it’s given me bacterial infections a few times where I’m full blown sick. It happened in July and I swore I had covid. High fever. Cough etc. Ended up being negative. I was shocked lol. Tuesday I felt a bit off, so I got tested and it was negative. Friday morning I woke up with trouble swallowing (not a throat ache but like a lump in my throat) still have it. Feels like it’s hard to swallow because something is stuck in my throat. Feel super fatigued too. I got another test Friday just to be extra safe as my husband has a job where he sees people all day. Not gonna lie I’m itching in my skin to get the results. I’m so worried I got it. I know this won’t be the last time I’m freaking out over how I feel because I’m super in tune with my body and I also have fibromyalgia. I’m in  area where my husband keeps reminding me that 500~ active cases in a population of over 1 million is still pretty small and I’m so careful. Anyway, my question is I can’t be the only one out there suffering with bad Covid anxiety? Let me know below!"
"Does anyone know how one can tell if difficulty breathing or shortness of breath is caused by COVID? Because one can feel some shortness of breath by anxiety, is it any different when it's caused by Corona?"
"Hi all,My first post here - would like to ask a genuine question.. Is there a scenario whereby showering after taking the train could possibly stop covid? My understanding is that if you've been exposed to it - it's too late, its in your system. Could it be possible that you can be exposed to covid and it would be only on your skin and you'd be able to just shower it off? or is that so unlikely to happen that there's little point?"
I’ve recently got my wisdom teeth extracted (a week ago). Healing is going moderately well. A week into recovery I am covid positive with very unpleasant symptoms. I am wondering how this might affect the healing process. Thank you.

"What would others think about the idea to commemorate the American COVID-19 dead by reading their names at an ""on-line"" ceremony?

"Hello everyone! Today I just got my results for covid and they were positive. I've been really sick for a few days and I just wanted to share my experience, keep in mind I have bad asthma along with this. First of all, my lungs haven't felt any worse. My throat however, is really messed up and I can barely speak. Along with that, I've had a bad fever even with medicine and I have had a hard time concentrating on things.  It hasn't seemed to get any better and I will post updates if people are interested.Edit: I forgot to mention the lack of taste and my nose. Whenever I eat something I either taste nothing at all or a very faint taste, I can taste almost no sugar and salt. My nose has this weird smell that kinda smells like metal, I do not believe it is blood but that is what it smells like.Update 1: Last night I went to sleep and woke up in a very bad state. I kept looking at my dog lying next to me and thinking she was dead and waking up repeatedly thinking me and my dog were in a video game together (this is while I was awake). After waking up in the morning I am no longer experiencing any confusion and my fever is almost completely gone. No other symptoms have changed. Oh on another note, I was the first confirmed case at the school and single handedly shut down our entire school, oops!"
"The news form 《thedailybeast》.The Nevada company fined for hosting a huge indoor Trump rally in defiance of state emergency COVID-19 guidelines is now seeking to cash in on the pandemic by selling decontamination stations.Along with inviting the Trump campaign to use one of its warehouses for a rally 100 times larger than the current Nevada limit of 50 people for public gatherings, Xtreme Manufacturing has been producing and marketing a walk-through enclosure that delivers a decontaminating mist.“The Xtreme Opti-Clean Cube will help reduce cross-contamination risks and alleviate the spread of viruses for those entering any building, construction site or public venue,” says a video posted by the very company that put more than 5,600 people at risk."
"I think I recall in the early days of laws against indoor smoking many smokers behaved like anti-maskers, including literally blowing smoke in the face of people who complained. Now people simply do not smoke in places where it is forbidden, no one argues about it as far as I have seen.EDIT: Related to this: remember how some wanted to quarantine HIV+ (I think they just call them AIDS victims) even though it was not transmitted via droplets? Would you guess the some of the same people who were overly worried about proximity to people with HIV then would be anti-maskers today?I don't think any diseases should be politicized: I felt in the 1980s/1990s that AIDS was being politicized also, that the might have been to lax in dealing with the illness -- I was not sure that you could not get it from, for example, mosquitoes that had fed on HIV+ people -- it turns out you could not but I wondered how we could be so sure.Bottom line, you try to deal with the disease as rationally as possible and politics should not enter into it, obviously."
Boris gave a speech outside downing Street the night before it was announched that he had covid 19.  At that stage he had to have been waiting for the results to come back and surely was putting others at risk.It's just u hear of people getting fined for doing just that and yet this has gone unnoticed.
I was thinking i should self quarantine for 7 days to see if symptoms show. If not I will think I’m fine.
"So I am hoping to get people's opinion who had mild to moderate covid cases. I tested positive July 18th and was sick for 6 weeks. I'm a relatively active millennial. This thing knocked me out. It's hard for me to know what sort of medical treatments I should be looking at. My breath is still short so I had an x-ray and CT scan done. Everything is looking good on that front. I'm currently getting my heart examined. What really bothered me was the cardiologist I went to seemed completely indifferent to my worries. When I talk to health professionals they, in general, don't seem worried about how this will affect me, and everyone else in the long term. The cardiologist ordered tests just to appease me but I don't know if I'm being dramatic or not!Has anyone had conversations with their doctors about what if anything should be monitored going forward? Has everyone felt supported by their doctors? What are people using as sources to help with their health?"
"Hi! Apologies if this has already been discussed, I did a search but got lost among news articles etc. I'm just wondering if anybody had a similar experience to me?I lost my sense of smell two weeks ago on the Sunday and then tested positive for Covid on the Thursday. I've not really had any other symptoms other than the smell/taste thing and being really tired. I've had colds that are worse than this.But, now, my taste and smell is starting to come back - I can't taste or smell subtle things (mild cheese or washing powder etc) but I imagine it will come back. However, I have a constant smell in my nose and it's not pleasant. It smells like sweaty shoes, or feet - like a gym changing room. I assume this is something to do with my sense of smell coming back but it's gross and it's actually making it  hard to get to sleep at night! I've tried countering it with strong smells like Eucalyptus oil but it's still there.I was just wondering if anyone had a similar experience and could confirm that it got better? 😬"
"Hi all.As winter approaches, please start thinking about getting a scarf to wear over your Covid masks...Else your exhaled water vapor might actually freeze within all the pores/holes of the mask and prevent further airflow and you’ll be forced to take it off. (I’m a medical doctor and engineer and I’m warning you all that this isn’t being thought about or talked about enough yet) Like a double pane window to prevent the inner layer from freezing.The other way around won’t work. Scarf must go outside of mask.Still must wear mask in winter.We keep viruses “alive” in lab indefinitely by freezing them."
"Anyone else out there feeling like they are insane? Gaslighted? I feel like I am totally alone in taking the pandemic seriously. I’m not even a shut in, I see certain people, I have to work. I feel like I am the only one concerned with being sick or getting others sick. It feels as though I am the only one who is social distancing. Anyone else in the same boat?"

"my idea is super simple in theory. Is it impossible to turn into reality? Please discuss, carry this idea on and in the best case, pitch it to someone who is an influencer or can bring this to public attention. So here it is: the whole world, every single person, goes into a 2 week lockdown. All nations, coordinated. Everyone takes two weeks off. The world stands still for the blink of an eye. No-one goes to work. Everyone has time to prepare, stock up on food, whatever. 2 weeks off for everyone and the whole world can return to normal. Or am I missing something? Be my guest and find a flaw in this idea."
"Wondering if anyone can put some fears to bed for me?I have an insanely bad gag reflex, like gag if the toothbrush touches my tongue wrong kind of bad. Pair this with a fear of vomit (being sick and seeing sick, the whole deal), and I am freaking out at the possibility of needing to do a test.I'm in NL where home testing isn't a thing like it is for family in the UK, and I don't want to go to a test center for fear they will be unsympathetic. Anyone had any problems with this?"
"I have had breathing problems the past two days that are growing progressively worse. I had to call into today because I spent most of my night/ morning in the ER. The ER only checked to make sure it wasn’t blood clots, heart attack, etc. I’m now trying to go and get a covid test. However, my boss is refusing to give me any sort of time off whatsoever. I’m getting written up for calling out because I was in the ER. I didn’t want to return back to work until I got my results back but now I don’t even have the time to go take the test."
"The news from 《thedailybeast》.Around the end of December, Kai, a high school student on the West Coast, came down with a bad bug.“I had a sore throat, a severe cough, pain in my abdominal region, a hard time breathing, and a high fever,” Kai, who asked to use only that name for fear of provoking his parents’ anger in an already tense relationship, told The Daily Beast.His worst symptoms eventually faded, but he still “felt extremely weak for weeks after,” as he put it. His doctors weren’t sure what to make of the illness at the time. But as awareness of COVID-19 spread in the U.S. this spring, Kai and his family agreed that he may have come down with an early case. So he eventually decided he wanted to get an antibody test—“to know if I did have it, and to see if there was some way I could help.”Epidemiologists are always eager for every scrap of data they can get, and a case like Kai’s could help them learn more about the way the virus spread early on, or its long-term effects in adolescents.But when he raised the idea with his parents, Kai recalled, they shut him down."
" 1.  Why in the hell did you even go to a wedding especially in Florida where there is rampant Covid and a governor with an IQ of 70? 2.   If you think you have Covid then you need to isolate for at least 2 weeks,  not just a few days or however long you can find a cool place to crash while trying to convince your roommates that you're not contagious.3.  Have you not heard of these things called hotels, extended stays? Some of them even have private kitchens and bathrooms. "
So I’ve working from home since March. Went into the office for the first time to pick up a device. Walked in and encountered two coworkers who weren’t wearing a mask( I couldn’t see others). I asked one of the coworkers if they were wearing masks around each other. She said no and that no one had symptoms so they weren’t wearing masks. I was flabbergasted and decided to step outside before getting the device. Our state mandates mask wearing inside of buildings &amp; I’m shocked that it wasn’t being enforced (which is uncharacteristic of them). Not sure what to do.
Recently had a coworker test positive for COVID. The entire department was sent home to quarantine for two weeks and told they couldn’t come back until they tested negative for COVID. The supervisor of the department told the boss that she had tested negative for COVID and asked to come back to work. Boss insisted on seeing the test results for himself. She finally sent them today and they were positive. Wouldn’t this be considered a fire able offense?
I feel like chicago should be flushed down the toilet for the way they're handling this. Half of the time people don't care if someone wears a mask. The cops don't care. The department stores dont care. And I feel like the health department doesn't care either. I reported my work for not following guidelines and they have been reported before. Are people following them? Nope. Chicago also increased capacity limits from 25% to 40% NICE. the mayor is as about as threatening as a loaf of bread. Woo chicago.
"I work for a pretty horrible company, can honestly say I’ve never worked for one that cares less about its employees. I had to take two weeks off earlier in the pandemic because my wife got COVID, and thankfully was paid the 80 hours through the CARES act. Now I am coming down with symptoms and am worried I will be stuck without any form of pay for 2-3 weeks. I haven’t been able to find any information about whether or not you are covered multiple times. I know my company will not pick up the slack. Does the CARES act cover pay for multiple terms of quarantine?"
"So, I have spent the last 8 months quarantining hardcore. As in - only leaving my house maybe 3 times to go to the grocery store (I can work from home 24/7). I was being so careful and watched everyone around me make allowances for outdoor dining, outdoor bars and outdoor activities in general. I held strong until I was invited to an intimate, outdoor concert. I only agreed to go because I was told me and my friends (4) would be seated away from everyone in a different section. We were. I had an amazing time and couldn’t believe I had been so anal about staying home.5 days later, I was one of 2 friends that attended the concert, to test positive for Covid-19. I had a mild fever, body chills, and slight GI tract symptoms. I was completely in shock and couldn’t believe this one outing would lead to me catching the virus. See, I am immune compromised and thought I had been so careful. I was terrified of this virus and expected the worst.I came here today to explain my symptoms and to see if anyone else related. Surprisingly, the day I tested positive (fever: 99.9), was the worst day for me. Of course, I thought this was just the beginning and that it would get more intense over time.I started taking Vitamin C, D, Zinc &amp; melatonin. After two day’s of symptoms, I felt completely normal and no longer had a fever. 5 days went by of feeling completely normal, so I decided to get tested again, and my test came back negative. I’m honestly in shock. I am so thankful that my case was so mild, compared to other family members who have experienced major symptoms and long term affects from this virus.I guess I really came on here to see if anyone had a similar experience?"
" I  just dont buy it. I dont think he has covid. I think he is an old man  that got run down tired from all the campaigning and decided to spin it  as covid to get sympathy, distract people from his tax fraud and white supremacy issues, avoid debates,  and so that he can make a miraculous"" recovery  and tell people that covid isn't so bad. The number one rule in PR is ""If you dont like what is being said, change the message.""What  Trump needed most in this campaign was sympathy and vindication so this  is just a PR stunt to achieve that. Im sure there are plenty of people  around him that do have it, but I just dont think he does. Not sure  about his wife either. Nothing being said about her in the news and she  has been covering up Trumps crimes for years.  His ""doctors"" have been cagy about information, and I have not seen a statement from a legitimate, unbiased media doctor. In fact, his personal  physician isnt even a medical doctor, he is a holositc medicine man. The  title doctor goes out to anyone with a PHD. This is the same guy that  prescribed hydroxychloroquine and advocated its use. I wouldnt trust  anything he says. And they are all heavily invested in that so they need to get the stock prices up so they can sell it off.Lots of people  saying he is ""being treated for covid"" but I have not seen an official,  credible document showing a positive result. This is just more  smokescreen BS. You can see his eyes and hear his voice, there is no  major illness. Its just a tired old man that needed a break and like the  con artist he is, he exploited the opportunity.Anyone else?"
"I've been taking all Covid precautions very seriously for 8-9 months, and my coworker recklessly goes to a wedding where many people got Covid afterwards, and she infected multiple people at the health clinic I work at, it has had to close due to staff illnesses. Me and one other staff member tested negative but I was only at the clinic Thursday and Friday so I didn't get exposed til later in the week.I've now started to develop a light cough, nasal drip, itchy and scratchy throat and congestion in ears. I tested yesterday and am awaiting results, but I'm just so angry at how people who don't take it seriously carelessly put other innocent people at risk. My husband is immunocompromised.  I just am disgusted with this and hoping my symptoms are allergies"
" I'm working on a project where I'm documenting the pandemic and looking for people to share their experiences, thoughts and feelings on the virus.\-I would like to incorporate handwritten experiences, thoughts and feelings about the virus in my book.

"I live in New York. Numbers are fairly low. We aren't contained but, you know, we're in a very different place than March. I was supposed to take a trip in a few weeks to see my mother in Ohio. Seemed like a good plan. She's been in isolation the entire time. I would be driving alone. Easy day.Except now Ohio, land of ""I'm not gonna wear no mask!"" just hit the threshold to get added to the mandatory quarantine list. One could argue that going and spending time with literally one person in one space is no big deal. But I'm not going to be the guy who brings this back to New York and infects my family (including my physician in-laws). It boggles my mind how many people are going on this ""mark of the beast"" rant about how the masks are just a method of control. Just wear the damn mask!"
"So I got COVID over 6 months ago: had the body aches that left me unable to walk up and down stairs for days, loss of smell, loss of taste, passing out, metallic smell/taste in my nose/mouth (literally my body just smelled like a dirty penny), and the nasal congestion. Never had respiratory issues during infection (had asthma as a kid). (EDIT: I’m a reasonably healthy under 30 adult)After 6 weeks, my sense of smell/taste wasn’t returning to normal.My favorite binge foods were: chocolate or Nutella and strawberries; and anything with garlic and/or cilantroAfter many attempts at eating Nutella and strawberries, idk it just tasted like nothing. It had a weird plastic-fake taste. I tried chocolate on its own - I can taste that it’s sweet but I just can’t taste the chocolate part. I tried chocolate cake - it tastes like some sort of lightly sweet cake, no chocolate. I moved on and thought, maybe I’ll taste it again.Cilantro tasted good before. I used it in almost every dish I made. It tastes like soap now. I tried it alone. I tried many different brands of cilantro, thinking it was a supplier or bad luck issue. I tried it in guac. I tried it with soup. Same soapy taste. And then garlic...I just can’t taste it unless I straight up bite into it raw. Like I can smell it and I love that smell, especially sauteed with chopped red onions and olive oil (childhood memory of mom cooking), but I can’t even taste it. My partner recently ate a piece of meat absolutely SMOTHERED in garlic and as someone whose entire cultural cuisine revolves around garlic and loves it, they were choking at how strong it was. I couldn’t taste anything.Today, I bought dark chocolate fudge and a half dozen of dark chocolate covered strawberries. From one of my favorite childhood stores. I had so much joy and hope that I could enjoy these things. They tasted like nothing.I’m absolutely broken hearted. I legit sobbed because something I loved for 20 years, I can no longer taste and it’s been over 6 months. Just to be clear, I am grateful for being alive, I am. I’m grateful I haven’t lost a loved one to this awful disease. I’m grateful that even though I was out of work for 6 months, I have a job to return to in my field, and I didn’t have to change careers. I am just so distraught that not only can I not taste my favorite comfort foods, the flavors that make up my cultural cuisine (which bring back good childhood memories of family), but my dream of retiring from my career and opening up a restaurant and cooking my favorite food feels so hopeless now...TL;DR I survived COVID over 6 months ago and I still can’t taste my favorite comfort foods and I’m so sad. Anyone experience this? I could really use some support"
"**My experience of the first wave, and what I learned from it.**During lockdown I had to work. During this time I spent most of my free time under a tarp in the empty woods, away from people and most comforts modern. It was the most peaceful month of my life. Not a plane in the sky, car on the road. Nothing but the sound of the wind and birds filling the pastel blue sky above me. During this month, I did not experience one day of bad weather, the grass was the greenest I'd ever seen it, the wildlife seemed the happiest it had been in a long time. I cannot express the beauty that surrounded me.Then we came out of lockdown, and safe to say it was shit. The weather became unpredictable, you could no longer hear the birds or wind for the deafening hum of traffic. The woods? Filled with people, littering, loitering and burning out vans on the access road.Masses of people rushed to their nearest Poundland, or Primark, desperate for that rush of endorphins released by making that cheeky purchase. Complaints of queues, shortages, the urge for 'normality' and shouts of ""What about me?"" Took centre stage. During this time I contracted covid, it was also shit.       One week of the known symptoms; no coughing thankfully, three days of ""I think I'm dying"", followed by two weeks of lethargy, headaches and what I can only explain as weak lungs. It's been about two months give or take a week since those unwelcome three weeks and I'm only just starting to feel energetic. During this time, the way I was treated by my employer (a large corporation) was shameful at times, and their treatment of others was a disgrace. I'm still employed, but feel even more like a number. (This is what will become of us all if we don't fix the economy, but that's a whole different subject).So, what did I learn during the first wave of covid?      We as humans have become a plague. We no longer work with nature, but instead have a yearning to annihilate it from our world to make space for more useless shit like a slightly faster smart phone (on tick), or a nice shiny new car that looks pretty much like every other car (on tick) simply to impress the person next to you. An individual who also has the nice car and the nice phone; most likely the same as yours, yet still we feel the need to peacock our purchased possesions and pretend that they actually are worth something when at the root, all they do is take up your genuinely valuable time. The cost of your time?A credit rating and a destroyed forest across the other side of the world .... You get my point?We aimed to become more compassionate with the advance of technology, medicine/healthcare, and even reaching for the stars. We aimed to become the society who lived with the earth and showed compassion for all human beings and animals alike. (Let's not forget the plants maaaan, we'd be fucked without them so let's stop eradicating vast quantities of them)Through all the promises and dreams, we became a society of greed and instant gratification. A society of hate and injustice. A society that will kill the very thing that lets us live simply to own more... More of what? Convienience.Covid is Mother nature's way of saying ""Stop it, behave or I'll send you to bed!"" We keep ignoring her, we won't be getting that new phone, we won't even get that new car. We won't get anything nice... We'll all die."
"Hello, hi im 13 obviously and here are my views on coronavirusSo in January i heard there was a virus going around in China and when the first case hit in Canada i was scared then when march hit with all the cases rising like a teenagers growth spurt i was scared the last normal day i had was march 13th then soon after that they shut down the schools and declared a state of emergency, i got scared as my mother has a compromised immune system and my grandfather has copd and is 73.I had always looked at this virus like umm lets say onions (i cannot express how much i hate onions)I DO NOT WANT THIS VIRUS it has scared me because personally i don't want to get it, i may not have a serious illness but others may and i don't want to have the guilt of giving it to them and them suffering or dying.I social distance as much as i can and when i see teenagers wasting the efforts there putting into stopping this virus it makes me sadYeah some of us are doing our part but what we have to do is to get the other people to listen to us appreciate what were saying 1million plus people didn't have to die, this is not a hoax, this is not the government trying to control us, this is real and it is effecting all of us in different ways.So stay safe.Remember to wash your hands, 6 feet away, wear a mask, and don't touch your face Simple as that we're not trying to make you convert your life and to live in fear, and in this situation its best to do thisMasking and social distancing has had soo many studies on it, masks do not lower you oxygen, no studie has proven that Look at the factsAnd for now thank you for reading my view on coronavirus as a 13 year old bye for now!!😷😁"
"Most scientists believe that COVID-19 is here to stay for good, like the flu and other respiratory viruses. If this is true, will we be under lockdown by the government forever? Will we always be forced to wear masks in every store and restaurant? Will we ever be able to go to a sports game again? Or a club? Or to a party? Will our children ever have a prom? I don’t understand. If COVID-19 is never going to go away, what is the point of all of this. At what point do we just say “whatever, we tried” and go back to living our normal lives again? I can’t imagine a world where we are forever living in fear/lockdown over a virus with an average of around 99% survival rate for all ages (even higher if you are below the age of 40 and healthy)."
"Hi, just hoping to get some different perspectives. Can't find a lot online.My wife has had COVID for almost a week now as she tested positive this past monday. Her symptoms have seemed very mild as she has had a slight cough and a pretty stuffy head. She thought she was rounding the corner today, but she noticed that she was coughing up some phlegm with a tinge of blood happened. She seemd to think the phlegm was coming from her head as she doesn't think her chest is congested.After a second time of this happening, she called a couple of urgent cares and to see if she could get examined in case she is developing pneumonia, but they referred her to the ER.Anyone else had a similar experience or thoughts? I was feeling better about the diagnosis until this happened."
"I’m just out of hospital having been diagnosed with covid, it’s super scary. I’m now out of work with 3 weeks, possibly going to be out much longer. Symptoms were not that bad until I was admitted to hospital. The breathing and fatigue is the worst I’ve ever experienced in my life. We’re currently on level 3 lockdown will possibly go to level 4/5 in the next week or so. I’m housebound now for two weeks well the whole family is! My heart goes out to all affected my this especially those who have lost their lives to it."
"Are we allowed to visit whoever so long as we stay 6 feet apart? I am in an argument with my family over it. I say no, they say yes. Please help me settle this, cause I definitely don't know for sure."
Sorry if this isn't allowed here i'm just unsure where else to ask
"There has been considerable concern about the long term effects of COVID. Many of us have favorite computer games. We can use our scores to get a hint if we have fully recovered. I have not had COVID, but I had a sleeping accident a week ago. I cut off circulation to my right hand and when I woke up my right hand was largely useless. I still had a lot of trouble using it several hours later. That was a fright. I could not tie my shoes, put my watch on my left wrist, or sign my name. I have largely recovered practical use, but I am measuring full recovery by comparing my performance on a hand-eye coordination game I have played, Bubble Bees.  I still have a ways to go.My nephew thought he had COVID so I asked about his chess ranking. His was a very mild case, if he had it at all, his chess ranking was not changed.So what about those who have recovered from COVID. Are you back, or are your scores and rankings down."
"In the absence of transparency, I have a lot of unanswered questions about the Orange One's apparent recovery from Covid 19. Is it possible to recover that fast? Is it common?"
The second wave has started but i dont know what to do since Latvia thinks WE SHOULDNT START EMERGENCY SYSTEM AGAIN and i have to go to school even with all this shit going on what do you think i should do? And my classmates dont even wear masks in public transport.
"The news from 《thedailybeast》. Standing outside one of the main buildings on the University of Connecticut campus last week, Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator, let out an exasperated sigh through her peach-colored face mask. Birx had been traveling almost non-stop since June, working with local and state officials to develop area-specific strategies for slowing the spread of the highly contagious virus. Connecticut was her 32nd state and, as in the others, she was peppered there with questions about the mixed messaging stemming from the White House. Seemingly frustrated by the fact that, 200,000 deaths later, there was still uncertainty about the federal government’s COVID-19 prevention strategy, Birx paused before laying out, yet again, her broken-record response: Wear a mask, wash your hands, and stay socially distanced. Wear a mask, wash hands, social distance."
For flu and covid. Everyone should be able to buy a box of these tests to keep in their homes so they can test themselves before visiting someone or going to the doctors unnecessarily and potentially infecting others. Testing like this would have such a positive impact on the control if spread. Why can't this happen?
"I work for a large school district which had us working virtually since spring break. We have only been back for four days and my mood has completely changed. Seeing people in the halls, even with masks, has made me feel so much more connected. I didn’t realize how much I missed socializing with my employees. In the past I kept to myself but I feel like a chatterbox now. Other people wish we were back home but I would rather wear a mask all day than work at home by myself. I have always been introverted but now I feel like Ive done a 180 to extrovertville. Can anyone else relate?"
"Kind of disturbing that there is no liability or obligation to an employer to inform their employees someone they work closely with has tested positive. I am sure it will be announced eventually but it is to late. Only found out because I talk with the guy that was tested positive outside of work.  We share a cubicle,  hes in his late 50s as well as the other 2 guys on our desk. One is extremely overweight with a heart condition, the other is a chronic smoker in his early 50s that lives with and cares for his elderly mom and dad. I am 30 in good health but am bringing it home to my family. No testing was provided,  no quarantine mandated. Seems like a gigantic shit show"
"[QuaranTime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icecreamfactory.quarantime) helps you quarantine the items you bring from outside your house or get delivered at home. It helps you follow the recommended quarantine duration for different kinds of items such as paper, steel, glass and so on. When a new item comes to your house, you just take a picture of it on the QuaranTime app, mention the kind of material it's made of, example cardboard, and either choose the suggested quarantine duration for that material or enter your own. The app will automatically keep track of all the items, when they were brought and how long till they can be released from quarantine. Once the quarantine duration for an item is completed, the app sends you a notification informing you that you can start using the item.With this approach you don't have to worry about remembering and recalling the start time for an item's quarantine. With the built-in camera and extremely simple interface it's also very easy and simple to add new items as they come."
"This chart would be better if it showed states that mandate masks, versus those that do not.  But there is a strong correlation in the US of political party (Republicans - not require masks, Democrats require masks) at the state level.  Look at both graphs all the way to the end.  It is striking.  Public policy matters.[https://dangoodspeed.com/covid/total-cases-since-june?fbclid=IwAR0xURTZ0VRZTpoZsmu6ASWXpWhrUTSNA1c114YkZnW2crLjYriiVBTQFoo](https://dangoodspeed.com/covid/total-cases-since-june?fbclid=IwAR0xURTZ0VRZTpoZsmu6ASWXpWhrUTSNA1c114YkZnW2crLjYriiVBTQFoo)"
"Hi. I know for personal experience and by listening to others that a lot of students are struggling this 2020 fall semester. Some people can’t pay for their rent, have children at home, and others are just doing poorly academically because their mental health is being affected.

"I'm in my 30's. Before COVID, I had very minor exercise related asthma. I needed an inhaler for it around once a year. Then, I got sick in March. Back then, it was almost impossible to get a COVID test and I had all the symptoms.  Including shortness of breath, I spent a night trying to decide if I needed to go to the E.R.. After everything, I noticed a lot of fatigue and what felt like asthma. So, I went on treating it like asthma, and took my inhaler whenever I felt like I needed to. I went home to visit my parents and grandmother and to help out, and while I was there my mom insisted I go to the doctor for the asthma. The doctor diagnosed heart arrhythmia. She mentioned my inhaler as a potential problem. I have follow-ups with a cardiologist all this month. I just wanted to warn other people who don't have my mother; if it's been a while since you had COVID and you are having trouble breathing occasionally, **GET THAT CHECKED OUT**! Yes going to a doctor in a pandemic is a risk, but the problem might be something that can kill you."
I'm scared of going to a testing facility and actually catching covid from the city. Sorry if this is off topic. Idk if I'm the only one. I have an appointment tomorrow and I have to get tested before going back to work.
"I HATE waisting peoples time, this will be a quick read.Had covidHad pneumonia Loved one diedI recoveredGot betterThen I started feeling shit again Chest started hurting Then the pain got so bad I wanted to die 7 hospital trips, nothing wrong Then swelling on my second rib where it meets my sternum 14000$ later I’m diagnosed with tietze syndrome They say I’ll never heal.I find a guy named Dr. Steven August.He sells a cheap physio appliance that I use to loosen my ribs and fix the muscles. Called back pod I go to physio / and chiro I HAVE MY LIFE BACK Nothing wrong with my heart or lungs or liver or stomach Just my bank account ...IF YOU THINK YOUR HAVING A HEART ATTACKIt “could” be tietze syndrome post covid or costocondritis.Good luck , stay safe"
"I have 0 exposure to Covid since the beginning of the outbreak. On Thursday, a friend of mine and I got boba together. He took a sip from my drink without asking but I just shrugged it off, and that was it and I left. He tested positive for Covid today. How concerned should I be? Because I'm shitting bricks"

"So My wife had take a Covid rest on Wednesday. Today at the hospital they said the results weren’t on file so they were doing them again. Turns out on Wednesday she was negative however now she is positive.She is healthy and has no symptoms but I am freaking out. I was on face time during the birth, but my son has been on this earth for four hours now and I haven’t met him and at this point I’m not sure when he will get to come home.I know other people like soldiers have it a lot tougher. But right now I’m freaking out and I just can’t say that. I have three other kids at home, and my wife I need to be strong for.  Right now I’m just typing to help keep my self under control. And well that’s what I have to say."
"I live in Canada, I hear everything going on in the US, I’m not here to rub that in, you guys have your hands full and I truly wish you the best, the situation over there is heartbreaking, the only reason I mention the U.S.A is because so many people here in Canada compare our situation to yours and go “we’re fine, look at the U.S. at least we’re not like that” but holy shit...  numbers may be different, but we’re being just as stubborn, it’s like no one gives a shit anymore, even my family and my friends. I mention wearing masks, or a second spike, or the need for social distancing, and I get stuff like “i don’t think these even work I wish we could just go back to normal something seems fishy about having to cover our faces,” or “the numbers don’t mean anything, I heard of some guy who died of a heart condition and they just labeled his cause of death as covid to up the numbers,” or “oh shut up, it’s fine, everyone I know is in good health and at an age that makes them low risk.” Not to mention the amount of vandalized or torn up covid information posters and signs I’ve seen, and how any video online relating to covid, even ones from  Canadian broadcasting stations, have comment sections that are legitimately 90% people calling covid a waste of their time. Like there’s people dying and everyone has the prettiest of excuses imaginable, “oh I’m fine I don’t have it yet,” I deserve to be able to go to the barber shop,” “it’s just like the flu,” “I’m at low risk so I should be fine.” I get that some of it is just coping mechanism, but holy fucking shit! I’m so fed up. I know it’s been months of this, that everyone is tired, we all wish things would be better, but they’re not, the numbers are rising not declining, the time for urgency is now, whatever we did back in March and April wasn’t enough, and now we’re at the peak of another covid outbreak and not a single person, it seems, even wants to entertain the notion that this may be more serious than a common cold. This may just be a rant, but I’m looking for anyone that has some similar frustration, I’m not insane for wanting to follow guidelines and keep the people I love and those in my community safe am I? This has all been such a shit show, and I am beyond disappointed and discouraged with the response from the people around me and our governments. Any scientist that has anything to say seems almost doomed to be ignored from the moment they open their mouth, and it’s insane."
"I suspect that I had the COVID between July /August 2019. I was traveling around Germany, I had a strong disease (COVID symptoms), but the doctors couldn't tell what was it at the moment, they gave me antibiotics and I had to deal with it for exactly 14 days. I remember feeling like dying (the constant fever, the headache, the lack of hunger, the lack of energy , the food tasteless, etc. Fortunately, i survived to whatever it was. I lost weight (muscle mostly) but i felt back to normal after couple months, ready to keep going, with dozens of projects and plans..Then the main pandemic happens, I started loosing my projects, I started losing my life, my people, is like if COVID attacked me back again, killing all the good things I had.I feel like dying again, like if I cannot fight the COVID, like if it is defeating me from the outside, worse than when I possible had it, it closed all my doors, it built distances, it have my hands tie, like if tie hands would be a new unbeatable symptom."

"Hello, to be quite frank I created a Reddit account because I want to reach out and hopefully get some answers. I had COVID back in mid June. I had some breathing problems and eventually was hospitalized for 4 days. I think that out of all the symptoms, the most traumatizing one was not being able to breath, gasping desperately for air as if I was drowning in a pool. I’m fully okay now or that’s what I try to think. Three days ago I got a cold and I realized that at night I wake up panicking because I’m scared that I’m not breathing. It’s like a thing in my head. I fear that drowning feeling. I start to freak out and feel like I’m running out of breath. I feel like my brain is creating some type of trauma and I’m just creating this for myself. But then I wondered that maybe I’m not the only one that is going through this. Problem is that some people are scared to talk about this. Even I am a little hesitant to post this but I want to know if anyone is also noticing some type of mental trauma post COVID and how you are dealing with it. I’m honestly tired of waking up at 2 am scared that I will die because I ran out of air. I hope that every time I get a cold I don’t experience the same thing over and over again. I just wish things could go back to normal for all of us."
"Four days ago, I spent a day in close contact with someone, who I just found out has a link to a COVID case. Their mother (who they live with), was “in close contact” with someone who tested positive. How concerned should I be?

"**The Swedish COVID-19 experiment of not implementing early and strong  measures to safeguard the population has been hotly debated around the  world, but at this point we can predict it is almost certain to result  in a net failure in terms of death and suffering.

But perhaps more striking are the findings of a** [**study published**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771841) **Oct. 12 in the** ***Journal of the American Medical Association*****,  which pointed out that, of the countries the researchers investigated,  Sweden and the U.S. essentially make up a category of two: they are the  only countries with high overall mortality rates that failed to rapidly  reduce those numbers as the pandemic progressed.** ![img](a4ttsymxuzv51 ""A man wearing a protective mask walks next to travelers as they queue up to board a boat in Stockholm on July 27, 2020.

And officials in other  countries, including at the top level of the U.S. government, are  discussing the strategy as one to emulate—despite the reality that doing  so will almost certainly increase the rates of death and misery.Countries that locked down early and/or used  extensive test and tracing—including Denmark, Finland, Norway, South  Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam and New Zealand—saved lives and limited  damage to their [economies](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/gdp-growth-rate).  Countries that locked down late, came out of lock down too early, did  not effectively test and quarantine, or only used a partial  lockdown—including Brazil, Mexico, Netherlands, Peru, Spain, Sweden, the  U.S. and the U.K.—have almost uniformly done worse in rates of  infection and death. Despite this, Sweden’s Public Health Agency director Johan Carlson has [claimed](https://www.svd.se/folkhalsomyndigheten-haller-presstraff-l07o) that “the Swedish situation remains favorable,” and that the country’s response has been “consistent and sustainable.” The [data](http://c19.se/), however, show that the case rate in Sweden, as elsewhere in Europe, is currently increasing. Average daily cases rose 173% nationwide from Sept. 2-8 to Sept. 30-Oct. 6 and in[ Stockholm](https://c19.se/Sweden/Stockholm)  that number increased 405% for the same period. Though some have argued  that rising case numbers can be attributed to increased testing, a  recent study of Stockholm’s wastewater [published](https://www.kth.se/aktuellt/nyheter/avloppsvatten-visar-stor-okning-av-covid-19-i-stockholm-1.1016275)  Oct. 5 by the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) argues  otherwise. An increased concentration of the virus in wastewater, the  KTH researchers write, shows a rise of the virus in the population of  the greater Stockholm area (where a large proportion of the country’s  population live) in a way that is entirely independent of testing. Yet  even with this rise in cases, the government is easing the few  restrictions it had in place. . . . . . . . . &amp;#x200B;The rest : [https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/](https://time.com/5899432/sweden-coronovirus-disaster/)"
"2.8 million people die each year from obesity. Assume that if people chose to eat healthy and exercise then the death rate wouldn't be high enough to justify a shutdown. In other words, healthy people have to suffer because of overweight people. In fact, studies on influenza suggest healthy children will be better off getting covid since immunological  imprinting will protect them when they're older. I'm just wondering why we don't do more to save lives related to activities that people with underlying conditions engage in. We could ban junk food advertising and prevent mcDonalds from preying on children by associating junk food with happiness. It should be treated like the tobacco industry.  I know this is a touchy subject, but I strongly believe we could save billions of lives by preventing the fast food industry from influencing our culture by spending money to help glorify big butts and the body positivity movement. Of course the fast food industry would lose billions of dollars if people weren't tricked into thinking big butts are cool, but it shouldn't be about the money."
"I have been wondering if some people would never show symptoms OR even test positive if routinely exposed.  For example, can some people breathe in covid and their body not even recognize it as a sickness or get into their system to show as positive ?"
I tested on Tuesday. Came back positive Thursday.
How are you all feeling? Maybe we can all share some of our thoughts in these uneasy times..
"The day my sense of smell and taste went away, that morning when I went outside, there was a funny smell in the air, nothing recognisable, just a strange kinda musty smell but no one else could smell it. By that afternoon I couldn't taste or smell anything, the following day I had a positive covid test.Fast forward a week most of the other developed symptoms have gone, and until today was just left with no smell/taste, but, that weird musty smell has returned, especially if I blow my nose. I am also just beginning to pick up on certain flavours when eating.Any other recovered people who lost taste experience this or similar?"
"At least to my mother.&amp;#x200B;Six days ago, a friend of hers was taken to hospital with a high fever. It turns out, he caught COVID-19. A few days later, he passed away from it. He leaves behind his wife, adult children and several young grandchildren.&amp;#x200B;I only met him a few times, but I could tell the type of man he was. Good natured and always thinking about others. His family meant the world to him and he always put them on a pedestal. He was a taxi driver and did school runs for our local special needs school. He always made sure his cab was spotless during this whole thing. He always wore a mask. He denied service to anyone refusing the wear a mask. He did everything right. So why did he still catch it and die?&amp;#x200B;I think this whole thing just became too real for me to handle mentally. I was told the news a couple of days ago, as I was about to pay a visit to our supermarket. I suffer from anxiety, so I take a lot of panic attacks. Walking through the supermarket, all I could think about was that poor man and what his family must be going through. The combination of that, plus the fact the shop was busy and noisy (which are usually triggers for me.) caused me to have a panic attack. It just hit me how real this virus is.&amp;#x200B;It just makes me hate the people ignoring the guidelines even more. To the point that I want them to suffer. I try not to hate others or wish anything bad on them. But I'm just so angry right now. I honestly don't know how to handle this. I took a little comfort from it not being personal. But now that it is, I don't know what to do.&amp;#x200B;I'm sorry if this isn't in the right place. I put it here because it's related to covid. If it's in the wrong place, please direct me to the more appropriate subreddit."
"Hey guys! I hope you’re staying safe out there with the virus going around. So, I wanted to ask a question just for my general curiosity. This question I have applies more towards those who don’t live in the United States. Here’s my question...what has your Covid-19 experience been like in the country you live in?The reason why I’m asking is because living in the United States, there’s a constant weight of just stress and anxiety when it comes to how we’ve handled Covid. Our politicians have politicized the virus, there’s ignorance among many Americans (these are the people that keep saying that Covid isn’t real or that they don’t want to wear masks), our government has handled the whole pandemic horribly and much more.Now, with that being said, I wanted to know what other people’s experiences were like when it came to dealing with Covid-19 in a different country. Are you guys somewhat back to normal but still being careful? Has your government done a good job in protecting the people? How are people treating Covid-19 and what are your thoughts?Let me know what’s up. Hope you’re staying safe and we’ll get through this in the end."
"Initially, all the advertisements were about how whatever brand is more vital now than ever and how they’re changing to help the covid times. But now I’m seeing ads with unmasked people in public and parties, as if the virus doesn’t exist anymore. Pretty frustrating"
"I had a mild case of Covid at the end of June. I lost my sense of smell and sense of taste for a few days, my sense of taste came back at about 60% I have had ZERO Sense of smell since having Covid, it’s now been four months. Has anyone else had this situation and gotten their sense of smell back? As for taste I can taste sour sweet spicy salty, things that taste buds sense but I have trouble tasting actual flavors. I’m looking to see if anyone has gotten their sense of smell back after four months and if there’s anything they can recommend that helps to get it back. Thank you! Update: will be starting smell training"
"Hi!I work at a school and we just went back to working in the building on October 16th. On October 21st, I met with a coworker in my office to go over information on a student. We were both wearing masks. A week later, I found out that that coworker had been out sick since October 22nd. She had a COVID test done yesterday, and I don’t know the results yet. For about a week now, I haven’t been feeling well, but it feels like allergies. I’ve been having just a slight cough, but today, the cough has gotten worse. I still think it might be allergies, but the paranoid part of me is scared it could be COVID. It’s been almost 2 weeks since my meeting with the coworker. I would think if it was COVID, my symptoms would’ve escalated a lot by now. Has anyone had experiences where symptoms came on slowly?"
"Hello all, coming from the SO of a partner who has lost smell/taste from testing positive for COVID-19 or coronavirus. They are a bit too nervous for a respond to ask these questions because food is a HUGE part of our life. They tested positive from a self-administered test via CVS in the beginning of July. Super congested when they took the test, so not sure if smell/taste was effected right then, but soon after it was. We researched and saw people getting it back a few weeks later and dismissed it. About 2 months ago, they realized it also depended on nasal deviation.At any given time, you have a dominant nostril. It switches every few hours. They have seemed to realize they are only able to taste/smell (since it’s related) when one nostril is dominant. They did test their other nostril first when they did the Covid test and claimed that that one hurt, while the other did not. Obviously the situation is super frustrating for both of us, mostly them. I don’t know how to support them and/or help find solutions. We have thought about seeing an ENT to make sure nothing was damaged during testing, but they are nervous about the results. Can anyone tell me about their symptoms? How long did your loss last? Any help?"
"That had to have been the worst day of my life. I walked into school, only to see that it got cut in half. I was very surprised as to why. That's also the night I got an email that they would be shutting down for a bit. Isn't funny how something so small, something we thought so positively we could contain spun out. The worry on everyone's face. I remember when it was still small, I was watching the news that day. So crazy how I thought nothing of it. Where are we now? Stuck. Hostile. Depressed. God knows when it will end. I hope for one thing when it does though. I hope the day is sunny, the air is warm, with a slight breeze. I hope just to sit on a bench with a nice book, and just be able to say ""Remember that pandemic? Haha! I know so crazy its over now though, right?"". To all of you thinking bad thoughts, you need to stay as strong as you can. Those sunny days will be back, hurting yourself or others will do  no good for you. Just keep on going, giving up is not an option. We will make it through this. Love you guys! Stay safe and wear a mask!"
So my fiancee works in the medical field I guess one of her patients caught covid and I had spent the night at the house she was staying at with him because our apartment was getting sprayed for pests. I was sitting on the couch next to him pretty much all night. Fast forward to yesterday afternoon I get called by her saying he tested positive for covid her job put her on leave for 28 days. I on the other hand was at work when I was told about this and immediately called my regional manager and told him what was up. He asked me if I had been following protocols (yes)He said alright just go and get tested if you want. In my state the CDC guidelines say that even if negative you should remain isolated for 14 days. I told my regular manager to take me off the schedule for the next couple of weeks because I had been in contact with this person. He starts flipping out on me and I just tell him that's it my right and it's the CDC guideline for this situation and he didn't want to hear it so I hung up. What should I do?
"My friend has been with his parents a lot (mostly his mom I guess) and he said that his dad tested positive and was quarantined in their house, he said that if his mom is positive he probably is too but he hasn’t said if he’s got tested or his mom and if he or his mom is positive"
For most people that had Covid what did you experience? My stomach has been upset in the morning and I feel congestion the back of my throat I’m not sure if I have Covid since I’m not having issues breathing but tonsils are definitely irritated. I kind of feel like I have a fever but my temperature is checking out normal.
"	Today was my second time getting tested for Covid-19.  I work weekends in a restaurant in NC, so indoor dining is allowed, and even though I wear my mask and sanitize constantly, obviously there’s plenty of room for infection. I started sniffling last Friday, and then my throat and left ear began hurting yesterday, along with a tightening in my lungs. Being the responsible adult I sometimes am, I scheduled an online appointment with my doctor first thing this morning and was able to see her before 11am. At the end of the video appointment she recommended I drive to the local hospital for a drive-thru testing of both strep and COVID. 	Here’s where my blood began to boil. There were four women working the tent behind the hospital, and I was the second of two cars in the line. Not exactly busy, which surprised me with how grand North Carolina’s infection rates are. Anyways, the two, I’m assuming nurses, taking information were lovely. Warned me about letting my co-workers know if I am infected, reminded me about the importance of quarantine until the results come back, and let me keep the pen I put my germs all over when I signed the form. Then I was first in line, and took off my mask so the other two nurses taking samples could swab both my nose and throat. These two were not exactly professional. One spoke loudly, seemingly intent on my hearing her opinions. The other agreed with everything she said.	Here’s what I heard while sitting there: 	“What, a strep test too? I’m surprised they don’t have us doing urinalysis’s and pregnancy tests also.”	“These doctors don’t care, they’re just raking in the money.”	She then asked me when my symptoms first appeared, which I don’t think is her business to ask, I’d already seen my doctor, she was only there to conduct the test. But I told her, and she said to the other nurse, “See? They’re sending people too early.”	I started doing that military breathing technique. In four seconds, out four seconds, to calm myself down. I couldn’t believe this nurse was bashing both my doctor and I for trying to be safe. And then I said so.	As politely as I could I said “Excuse me, but I’m trying to keep my coworkers safe, you two are medical professionals, or you’re supposed to be. You can at least save your opinions for when the patient can’t hear you. You should be glad people are getting tested.” 	I’m sure I wasn’t quite that eloquent, but that’s pretty close. They both shut up and didn’t say anything else while I was there, and I drove off fuming and shaking. I should have asked for their names, but in my defense I was rattled, and I’m not sure they’re required to tell me anyway. But halfway home I pulled over. It dawned on me just how fucked up it is to publicly discourage people from being tested WHILE PERFORMING YOUR JOB AS A NURSE. Like, take your scrubs and mask off before spouting personal opinions. I wondered how many other people these nurses made to feel were wasting their time. How many wouldn’t come back for fear of getting in the way.	I called the hospital and was transferred to the “patient experience” line to report what happened. The woman who transferred me was awesome. Not only did she not make me feel small for being perturbed at what happened, she was horrified as well, and told me “Listen, you’re going to get (the woman in charge) voicemail. Leave your name and number and the details of what happened, because she WILL want to hear this. Sic’ em!”I have a lot of anxiety, and my depression is worse than ever these days, along with everyone else. But I did my best, ya’ll. I’m still waiting to get a call back from the hospital, and I hope they are able to reprimand these medical “professionals” properly."
"My husband and I have taken COVID very seriously and have not done much of anything since March 13th. I am a teacher working from home and my husband doesn't work. We order our groceries curbside, use target curbside, and amazon for our home purchases. My family on the other hand has gone to weddings, flew to Disneyworld, road tripped cross country, and they all have gatherings without masks on. While my sister and her husband were in Disneyworld last week, he decided to propose. Today I get a text asking if I was comfortable going to their wedding that they are planning for December of this year. I am beyond frustrated with them and I quite frankly feel crazy. I told my sister I would attend the outdoor ceremony but everyone should have to wear masks. I don't understand the blatant disrespect and lack of care for others they are around. We live in Las Vegas and our family and friends still go to bars, parties, and gather together. It baffles me. Does anyone else feel crazy? Why are we the only ones taking this seriously?"
"It's known that children often have asimptomatic disease and can spread it to older members of their family.And an argument that 'parents can't take care of kids when they're home' is invalid for teens and highschoolers.Also there are kids with chronic diseases for which going to school is dangerous.If nothing else, why can't they enable for only some kids, that would want to or have no other options, to have online school?"
"I am absolutely terrified to get reinfected as my symptoms lasted from end of March to the end of August. I had different symptoms throughout and nothing like a regular flu. It was slight fever that lasted about 2 months with chest congestion. Vibrations in body. Severe dehydration to the point no matter how much water I drank I could not stop feeling thirsty. I felt like I had a Uti and a kidney infection. kidneys hurted along with liver pains. Cough, diarrhea, joint pain, hairloss. Felt like my bones were fragile. Nail indents. Skin had white heads extremely dry and started to get red dots on my legs and arms. A few patches of rash around my ankles and arms. Hands started to turn a different color from the rest of my body. Severely exhausted couldn’t even take a shower in the hot for long. Was scared to sleep felt like my blood was pumping too slow. Almost fainted on my monthly,  could feel my hands and feel my feet get cold and tingling when I was about to black out scary feeling. My blood felt like it was poison running through my body. Sensitive to everything. I had blood test done and found out I was celiac sensitive because of this. A lot of my symptoms felt like as if I was developing an autoimmune disease like lupus. The first 2 months I felt as if I can handle it but when the oxygen levels and weakness started happening later in months it was so scary.Somedays I would be fine but when mopping or doing something to put strain on my body I would feel bad the next day. I even had to stop having sex due to bringing on a whole new set symptoms again such as fever and feeling down and exhausted. I have slowly heeled and feel almost there but know I have fear of going out and catching it again. Not to mention my son caught it and had heart palpitations and similar  symptoms as me he is still going through GI symptoms and can’t eat.   I never want to experience it again. Worst traumatic experience of our lives."
"Hi all! I kept a detailed log of my experience with COVID-19 because I couldn’t find a lot of in depth information like I wanted and I am sure there are others out there like me. Disclaimer* everyone is different and experiences different symptoms. But outside of needing to be hospitalized, I had every single symptom the CDC listed. I’ll list when I got those symptoms and how long they lasted for. Exposed 10/19-10/21 while at work. Symptoms first appear 10/23 (day 1). Fever or chills - day 3-5Cough - day 8 to present Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing - day 8 to presentFatigue - day 3-7Muscle or body aches - day 3-7Headache - day 1-5New loss of taste or smell - day 4-9Sore throat - day 1Congestion or runny nose - day 1-5Nausea or vomiting - day 3-7 (only nausea no vomiting, but it really felt like I needed to)Diarrhea - day 4 and only for a few hours As you can see most of my symptoms happened within the first week but the cough and shortness of breath didn’t really show up until everything else subsided. I’m currently on day 17 (11/8) and I’m able to take larger breaths now but still get winded when doing simple things like walking the dogs or cleaning up around the house. It DOES get better. For a couple days there I thought maybe I’d need a corticosteroid inhaler but just take it for what it is and take small faster breaths, and try not to feel too anxious about it. If you have any questions please ask and I will do my best!"
"My daughter was exposed at school and is quarantined.  I lost most of my sense of smell, many normal things I can’t smell at all and others I can smell faintly if I am close up and I have lost all ability to taste bitter it seems.  I also have a dry cough, but it is so mild and infrequent I ordinarily wouldn’t think much of it.  TMI: all my stools have been lose throughout all of this but I am not sure it is related.  My daughter and husband complained of a sore throat and headache, but no other issues and that has already resolved.  None of us have had a fever at all.  We all went to get a test the day after I started to loose my sense of smell and all of us came back negative.  Obviously we are all self quarantined until my daughter is able to return to school in another week, but should I just take the negative test as meaning that my loss of smell is due to some other virus or other cause? It just seems so strange to have that and not have COVID when everyone is talking about the sense of smell thing, but I know COVID is not the only thing that can cause that."
"I have been offered the chance to be part of the Covid 19 vaccine trials due to my age, health and not having any substance/medical issues.  They even pay quite a bit to make sure you come in for follow up testing as required.  The real problem is that although I am very willing (but scared to help); I question the safety of testing a not yet approved pharmaceutical.I am seriously asking for opinions, I can only see it from one perspective (my own of course)."
"So the other day it was my friend’s birthday. He decided to have a very small low key hang with just 6 people. We were pretty chilling, just hanging out, and most of us Biden supporters. However, we didn’t talk about that because one of his friend’s was a Trump supporter. Fast forward a few days and my friend gets sick, gets tested, and has COVID. It happens, it’s almost common place now. So he does the usual, tell everyone who was there that he got it and we should get tested. The turn around of it all is honestly ideal and we’re all quarantining, it seems, in a timely manner. But when he tells his Trump supporter friend, this bitch literally tells him that she had a fever the week before but she didn’t think it was a big deal. Meanwhile she knows my friend lives with his much older parents. Like why are Trump supporters like this!? It’s just so self-centered and almost despicable."
"I just wanna say, I’m still practicing social distancing, wearing my mask even when outside, don’t go out to party, don’t even go out to eat, and using half a bottle of hand sanitizer anytime I leave the house. But as each day passes by, I’ve noticed I started to be less concerned about catching it. It’s gotten to the point where I’ve started thinking “ehh, it’s just a matter of time now”. I’ve been in close contact multiple times with family members who’ve tested positive. Of course I got tested multiple times and thankfully tested negative each time so far. I’m just not even worried anymore. I’m still practicing the procedures so I don’t spread it. I just feel like I shouldn’t have this “whatever” mindset about it."
"The minks in Denmark have evolved a strain that might not be susceptible to vaccines and existing antibodies.Denmark has tried to cull its minks, but the opposition parties are trying to stop that now. Could the strain in Denmark get us right back where we started?"
"So I got a positive test on Friday and I felt fine besides being extremely tired all week, but tonight I had a fever for the first time (100.8 f). This comes after the first day I’ve felt normal. Anyone else get a fever later on?"
I have been at home for the whole of the corona virus and I was going insane it’s my birthday coming up so I went to visit a friend for 2 days but on the 2nd day I couldn’t taste anything I have now come back home and got tested I’m so ashamed and embarrassed that I may if spread this virus to other people especially my close friends I am over some with worry and have informed people what do I do
"I felt fine last week until Thursday came around. When i woke up Thursday morning I felt sick. Later on in the day I had back and hip pains. I was overall uncomfortable. I started to have sweats and chills. Have been taking acetaminophen and vitamin D. Sunday night I realized i cannot smell or taste anything.Today I slept most of the day. My s.o came over three days last week. He knew i didnt feel well and my family was sick. He did not seem happy said he would speak to me later. Haven't heard from him in several hours.Edit: I have been keeping track or my symptoms. I took a shower at 4:00 am yesterday. I just stood in the shower because I did not want to get out. I began feeling queasy. As soon as I got out and started walking I became wobbly and dizzy. Everything started to turn black until I sat down and closed my eyes. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this with covid. I'm honestly terrified of what can happen now. Not sure if that is because of covid or something else. I also noticed I am fatigued from doing nothing all day. I went to bed at 5 am and woke up at 2pm. Stayed in my room all day, don't really have much of an appetite but I still ate some soup. I played the sims a little bit but got tired so I kayed down and fell asleep on and off from 9:45 to 3:am.I've noticed I stay awake for 7 hours before I get tired and fall asleep again. I get a little dizzy on and off. I'm congested and feel mucus drain the back of my throat. I feel it mostly in my sinuses. If I inhale my nose tends to burn."
"She has been going out every weekend since the whole thing started. She spent the entire day with someone Tuesday, dropped off her dog on us on Thursday so she could go camping for the weekend with *more* friends, called and told us her first friend tested positive on Saturday. Meanwhile she stayed on her camping trip with her other friends!! and didn’t get tested until Monday. I’m getting surgery tomorrow to see if I have CANCER and now I’m paranoid that I could have it and I could be spreading it to doctors and elderly patients when I go in. But I can’t afford to put this procedure off. And she won’t have her results in until after I have to go inIt’s fucking unreal how stupid and careless and selfish people can be. Her elderly parents will die if they catch this and she continues to visit them every weekend to drop her dog off for her vacations and parties during a fucking pandemic"
"I recently got hired at a job where I was interviewed and trained by a manager who tested positive for COVID-19 and I worked with them for at least three days writhing 6 feet for numerous hours. I was not informed of their positive test or why the manager was gone and was sent to be tested a few days later “for being a new hire for protocol” as I was told. The day I went to get tested was the day I began getting symptoms for the first time and tested negative. Each day that passed I got more and more sick thinking it was allergies and got tested once more in my own over the weekend before returning to work. I come to find that I was positive and got a false reading since it was too early on and asked my district manager multiple times if my employer had tested positive and was told no. After remembering that they had actually told me of their symptoms while at work but said “don’t worry I don’t have COVID” I found it strange that they requested “vacation” during peak season for four weeks. I have now recovered from over two weeks of quarantine and had to pay to get retested to return and found out that they purposely did not inform me that I was exposed to them for reasons I still don’t understand. I was not paid for sick leave or given the chance to take precautions with my high risk family members. What can I do in this situation, how can they be able to do this?"
"I was assigned to a nursing home yesterday and I asked a nurse if they have been hit hard by it. She just said yes and started pointing out all the rooms that were vacant because of residents they lost.  They have put names of staff on many of the rooms so it doesn’t look so horrible to the residents in an attempt to keep their spirits up.edit:  this is in Utah which has a very low death count, thus a very high number of COVID deniers.  The Republican government here doesn’t report COVID deaths for those who have underlying conditions (“they probably wouldn’t have died if they hadn’t had the underlying condition so they ‘died from the underlying condition’”) keeping the numbers artificially low.  Please!!! for the love of your friends, neighbors, family members... stop ignoring it, and stop spreading it!!!"
"My mother went to a supermarket with my sister and father, 4-5 days ago and told me it was super crowded. I refused to go because I knew about the place and had expected the crowd. She got covid and tested 3 days ago. Luckily my mother's sister has a hotel and we sent her to one of the rooms. She was feeling better with medications after a day. Now next day, the remaining members of family got covid tests done, just to ensure. None of us had any symptoms and we were chill. My mother is in the hotel room alone. The following day, test results came and turns out I was the only one positive and everyone else negative. Now this was today afternoon. I had to pack my stuff and come to the same hotel, and we shifted to a bigger hotel room. We are together here. My sister is in her college. She's a doctor. She's also getting some symptoms.  My father doesn't have it, but he's alone at home, feeling sad that he's alone. Idk what is going to happen, but it's really sad that we can just chat on video call. I have no symptoms nonetheless. None. No fever. No spo2 drop. We've constantly monitored it every 3 hours. It's Diwali in 3 days and another major festival. I wish nobody has to go thru this during festival times."
"I work in private food retail - have been since prior to the outbreak of COVID. I have encountered several customers over the past months not wearing masks, and have easily been able to kindly diffuse such situations, but much recently, I have encountered a customer with a fake ADA medical exemption card. I wanted to know what is sound and legal counterargument against fake claims of such person that it is against ADA policy to discriminate or refuse service, when we are indeed a private business and set our own policies. I know this medical exemption card to be fake, because no medical doctor would give out such a card - the woman literally said she ""ordered it"" and caught her lying in the act. Any help on such a response would be beneficial :)"
"For the last week I’ve been sick, at first it started with nonstop sneezing, then insane head pressure, fatigue, sore chest, and now for the last two days I’ve lost my sense of taste and smell. I haven’t gotten properly tested, but I’ve been treating myself at home and I feel a lot better but I cannot smell ANYTHING. It’s honestly making me miserable, so I’m wondering how long this could go on for. Has anyone else lost their sense of smell whether it was due to Covid or another illness?"
" I just moved to a new position in my call center. Previously I had my own safe space that was clean and only my area. My department took HR’s guidelines for a safe work environment seriously. They sent people home to remote work, they make everyone wear masks, no one goes to the managers desks they IM or email, they skip desk cubicles between people, and even encourage us to stay 6ft apart when we are going to breaks etc. Yesterday I started my new position as you can see I am sharing a desk cubicle with 2 other people. I asked if I would have my own desk and they said they don’t know yet and for me to sit there for now. It’s originally person A’s desk and then a person B is usually sitting in it when I come in at 4pm. She sees that I am there and she gives me the desk. Today I had additional training so they had me sit with someone who could teach me something new at their desk. He wore a mask 95% of the time and then at the end removed it. This guy was hack coughing away the day before and he did so today as well when he was masked. As you can see I feel very uncomfortable and I don’t think that this is safe. I believe I read per CDC if someone in your home gets covid to not share electronics with them what so ever. There’s literally 3 people sharing the same computer, chair, keyboard, and mouse. BTW I’m in the USA. So idk if that makes a difference. Just needing some guidance."
"One of my family members tested covid positive today, everyone else seems to be showing symptoms so far except for me. I had a little bit of a scare a couple months ago but it turned out to be no more than a cold. I’m worried about getting it. I have asthma and it worsens when I get sick. I’ve informed my employer, not sure if they’ll allow me to work until everyone remains COVID free. This is gonna suck. Especially if I get it myself. I don’t have anywhere else to go.  What are some precautions I should take?"

In that episode Suzuki says""Pandemics start in China more than anywhere else, the reason is that's where more people than anywhere else are in close contact with animals"" It's during a clip showing a woman there throwing some grain towards birds who are flying about in the thousands.One of those TV things you watch and forget and remember when some incident in the world triggers your memory."
"I know it seems small in the scheme of things, but as someone who makes a serious effort to be “healthy”, this shocked me. A few days into having symptoms of Covid, I lost my taste and smell. Honestly, I was excited to not have cravings for all my usual weaknesses. Dark chocolate, froyo, muffins. Except...they didn’t go away. And the stranger thing, when I would have a small piece of chocolate or banana bread (my ‘healthy’ banana bread),  my brain felt “satisfied” yet I couldn’t taste a thing. (What a waste of calories LOL). All of that “sugar is just as addicting as cocaine” talk has some truth to it."

"I’ve been told to self isolate due positive COVID-19 result, should I take another test after 14 days isolating or I can carry on with my life not worrying about infecting other people even after quarantine?"
"I tested positive for covid in late August, and lost my sense of smell at the time. 2.5 months later, I have yet to get it back. I was wondering if long term loss of smell was something that was common for others as well. I'd like to be able to smell lol"
"I woke up in the morning with a bad fever, hot as hell sweating, and equally cold, shivering and shaking, both at the same time. I was pretty delirious, was thinking about things that don't make sense.  I couldn't imagine getting up because of how fatigued I was. I planned on getting school work done today but there's absolutely no way I could have gotten anything that takes energy done.  I had a headache the whole time and felt dizzy as well. I could taste but not very well, just barely. Same with smell. That went on for hours and I feel a little better, but definitely not even close to 100%. I can't write very well either, takes too much thought and energy. I had my flu shot a few months ago, so the chances of it being a flu is highly unlikely. I haven't eaten anything all day, and I ordered some pizza, ate two slices that barely tasted like anything and I can't eat any more. Do I have COVID?"
"Allow me to shed some light on some symptoms I had leading up to getting tested positive for covid. Please share the symptoms you experienced that looking back were early covid symptoms.Hindsight being 20/20, I remember a few specific instances that should have set off alarm bells but didn’t. In a society where you’re encouraged to suck it up when you’re sick, go to work/school and get on with life, it’s no wonder I could have so easily looked past these symptoms. Anyway...I was at Bed Bath and Beyond buying some home supplies and I remember standing in line on one of those 6ft markers and thinking, “Man I feel tired. I either haven’t had enough coffee or I am just super out of shape.”I remember singing in the car one day and the next day feeling like my voice box was sore. I have definitely lost my voice on more than one occasion from singing loudly and I figured this was the same as before.I remember waking up and not really being hungry which is so not like me, but I figured eh... my appetite would come back for lunch- no doubt! It didn’t.Then the last one was my back felt achy sore. I remember sitting on my couch watching Euro Vision with Will Farrell and thinking man my lower back is feeling uncomfortable. I figured before bed I’ll do some yoga and that will help. It didn’t.After I got tested and it came back positive then from there my symptoms progressed to tightness in the chest, exhaustion, inability to smell, &amp; 99 degree fever. I didn’t have a cough. It’s so mind boggling that I could look past and excuse so many early symptoms. I guess my brain didn’t want to believe it could be true."
"I was wondering if anyone has stories of their experiences with Covid and being  obese? I know that it drastically increases your chances of  complications and death so my anxiety is peaked. I have lost ten pounds so far and am motivated to keep going, but I'm so terrified that if I get it, I will die. I don't want to die. I have PCOS so I have struggled with weight ever since puberty. I have high blood pressure as well but I am doing everything possible to manage it.  I stay home, besides grocery shopping but my husband is a teacher so I can't really isolate completely. Please be nice. I am just a scared woman needing facts and not the fear mongering that I've been seeing. I know that obesity is bad and I hate that I am obese and I am ACTIVELY working on it."
"	I had chest pain this week and had to go to the hospital. I went to Jefferson in center city Philly.  I dread going to any ER but now with all the Covid-19 patients, I really really didn't want to go. I put on a mask went in. When I got there the place was packed.  I had to keep reminding myself not to touch anything. The waiting area had been divided in half with plastic but both sides were totally full. I found out later that the idea was to keep all the COVID patients together on one side and the other patients on the other. Unfortunately there were so many COVID patients that both sides of the waiting room were full with COVID patients. The triage nurse sorted the patients and kept everyone organized. It was pretty amazing. She juggled a man demanding a Japanese translator, a woman having a miscarriage and about 30 COVID patients. And me. I asked her how she did it. She said she really didn’t know, we just keep on doing our jobs. 	It seemed like every person ahead of me in line was COVID positive. I wondered how long I could hold my breath. Luckily when it was my turn and I said that I had chest pain, they took me in the back for an EKG. Since the internal waiting rooms were also full of COVID patients, they put me in an ER bay. I closed the glass doors and sanitized my hands. I don’t know which had me most scared, the chest pain or COVID patients.	When my nurse came in, she was wearing her standard PPE. She had on an N95 mask, a surgical mask, goggles, face shield, gloves, hair bonnet and a gown. She smiled, reassured me and got to work. How in the world do these people work with all that on? She started an IV without missing a beat. A series of physicians came and went, all dressed head to toe in PPE. Housekeeping stopped in wearing their PPE. Everyone smiled and just did their jobs. No one complained or cut corners. They just did their jobs. Some were working extended shifts. I’m sure many skipped their breaks and lunch. They just did their jobs.	Since March when the pandemic began, we have lost 1700 health care workers to COVID. Just for comparison, 84 police officers were lost in 2019. When one of our police or fireman die in the line of duty, we try to support their families. They get posthumous promotions, funeral processions to honor them and more. We thank them. We honor them. We show the world how grateful we are for their sacrifice.	In my opinion ALL healthcare workers from housekeeping to physicians are more than heroes. They are superheroes. Every single one of them.  They just shut up and get to work. Somehow my nurse found the time and energy to reassure me, compliment my nail polish and offer me something to eat. My ER physician went on a hunt to find me a pillow. Someone brought me water. 	There were no beds available so I ended up staying the night in the ER. Late that night I overheard the staff teasing one another and talking about their families. Someone announced a nurse’s birthday on the overhead speaker. Staff sprinkled throughout the ER clapped. They truly cared about one another. They were a team. They had each other’s backs. 	At the beginning of the pandemic the hospital had set up a testing station right where I park when I drop Jolene off. Early in the morning I would see the nursing staff setting up for a long and dangerous day of testing patients. Then I saw the nurses form a circle to stretch and do some jumping jacks before they started their day. Then they did something that shocked me. They danced. They laughed. They elbow bumped. They created joy. Then they got down to work and did their jobs.After a few weeks of this they even made a video of their dance routine and it was shown on the ELLEN show.https://youtu.be/SKdCfWYSj4I	I worked in a hospital for 30 years. Although I am not a nurse, I get it. They form bonds and work families with their coworkers. I can only compare it to the bond soldiers have going into battle together. They have to do things they never thought they could. They see things they wish they could forget. They hear the primal cries of people finding out someone they love is gone. They hold the hands of patients dying alone. They watch multiple patients die on a single shift. Then they just go home and make dinner. Only other coworkers really get what they are going through.	When you work in healthcare you know on a certain level there are risks. Years ago it was hepatitis, then HIV but no one ever anticipated this. They worry about bringing COVID home to their kids or their elderly parents. They do their very best to protect their patients, their staff, their families and themselves. Many will deal with PTSD from all this. But they just keep doing their jobs. Healthcare workers are a special breed. They are risking their physical and emotional health to help complete strangers. And 1700 of them have made quietly made the ultimate sacrifice. No news stories. No processions carrying their body home. No scholarships for their children they left behind. They were just doing their jobs. They may look like just normal people but they are not.They are real life superheroes.Saying thank you is not enough.They are tired. They are burnt out. And the next wave is here.Don’t make their jobs any harder.Please, Please...Just wear that mask."
"You know how people are always saying ""I'm SO safe!"" And then you hear that they do something that you think is reckless?  Is there currently, or can someone create, a quiz that you take, along with weighted answers for things like frequency or riskiness, that people can take?  So, if you want to hang out, you can just say ""What is your COVID number?"" If they say ""I'm a 17,"" and you're like ""I'm a 3,"" then you get an idea of whether you should hang in person.  Thoughts?"
Ever since Wednesday I've had cold symptoms. I had a test on Thursday and haven't got my results. Yesterday I started to not smell or taste. Still feels like a cold. Can I assume I will test positive? I'm so distressed
"At the job I have currently we have 6 people who now have covid, and for some reason the owners want to keep it quiet from everyone. This seems highly highly unethical and not safe. What should I do??I should say I’m in Illinois in a very very bad county for covid."
"Unfortunately I just tested positive today and the doctors were telling me abt the taste and smell problem, I pretty much lost both and can only get a faint taste of sum foods, I was wondering if anyone else had the same problem and how long it took for the taste and smell to come back"

"Currently in college, just trying to get through my final year honestly. I don't really care about anything anymore. I've been struggling so much to do any work at all. Everything is online and it feels like half the professors just dont give a shit so why should I? My aunt had open heart surgery and I couldn't even visit her, I still can't because of this damn pandemic. Now I'm gonna be having my pet put down and I don't even know if I can be with him. My boyfriend lives hours away so I don't have him either, I'm just stuck alone in my house waiting for everything to be over. I don't care anymore if I pass my classes. I have tried to get help but nothing changes and nothing feels like it matters anymore. The world is fucked and so am I honestly . . ."
"Everywhere I go, I see these tents full of people outside restaurants. A couple of months ago, they would be fairly open, allowing air flow. But now that it’s getting too cold for that, almost every tent I see lately is sealed up tighter than a drum. So how is that supposed to be any different from eating inside the restaurant? You’re still sitting in an enclosed space, surrounded by strangers, all expelling invisible droplets of saliva and microbes."
"I recovered from COVID-19 back in March and got an antibody test in June. I just started my Master of Journalism program in Canada and find my perspective on the pandemic is different from that of people who have not (thankfully) contracted the virus.I'm researching a news story on how people may (or may not) have a change in mentality or lifestyle after recovering from COVID-19. I want to see if there's anything we, people who lived the COVID-19 nightmare, can teach or share with others after recovery and possible insights to a post-COVID world.Anyone from the US or Canada want to share their story through a phone interview for publication?Thanks a lot guys, looking forward to your DMs!"
"People are suffering from COVID fatigue. They are letting down their guard which is increasing the R. The case numbers are soaring and deaths are rising.In World War 2 they kept their spirits up with the hand sign, V for victory. We should bring back this hand sign, but today it can be V for vaccine. This can be a reminder to everyone that they will be vaccinated soon, so hang in there, wear a mask, wash your hands, social distance, and be careful for a little while longer.It could also encourage people to get vaccinated when the vaccines become available to them. That way we can reach herd immunity faster. R can be driven below one, and COVID-19 can be driven into extinction or sent back to the bats or other animal where it came from.Here is a link to Churchill giving the V for victory hand sign.

"I'm so sick and tired of it. All of you know, intellectually, that suicide is the best answer anyway."
"So I think everyone is aware temperature checks at the workplace are useless. It seems like none of these hired health contractors know how to use a thermometer. I actually went to the ER last night and I tested negative for covid but I have a cyst on my lung (totally unrelated to covid) and I’ve had a fever for a week. Yet.... all week I’ve been temperature checked and it’s 96 which is already not accurate as my normal temp is 98. However today after doing the temperature check, she got 101 five times and finally asked me to step out of my car where she finally got a reading of 96. I’m about to go tell my manager because this is foolish. You got 101 five fricking times stop fishing for a normal temp. Of course when I step outside my car into 30 degree weather when it’s windy af I’m going to get a low temp. That’s ridiculous to me. Now I know I don’t have covid already but I do have an infection which is why I have a fever, but the point still stands. I have a temperature and instead of taking it at face value they try and try again until it’s a normal temp. When I got back in my car I used my own mouth thermometer and my temp is actually 103, so even the no touch thermometer they use is usually always 2-3 degrees off because they’re like 3 inches of space between the thermometer and your forehead. No wonder covid is spreading so much, people don’t know how to read a thermometer. I don’t know why businesses are still using these as screening tools when they’re not accurate and even when they do hint at someone being sick it’s brushed off. It was like this at my other job too, this isn’t the only place that’s don’t this."
"I can’t believe it. Someone said to me in anti-lockdown defense to “not let it dominate” me. I’m dumbfounded. All this time and money spent on research by professionals and it’s as simple as not being submissive to COVID. Thanks, random Redditor, for the cure!"
"All of my friends are going out to bars, house parties and are hanging out without masks or social distancing. I feel like I am the only millennial who is concerned. I live with my parents and have put my social life on the back burner because I don’t want to risk their health by going out just because I’m bored. My friends also don’t want to wear a mask with me and therefore I don’t want to hangout with them because I don’t feel safe. Anyone else struggling with this issue? I also feel extremely lonely and I see all my friends having fun and going about life. I’ve also lost friends due to arguments about this subject and even my dating life has taken a hit."
"So we all know not to touch surfaces and then touch our eyes, nose or mouth because that could give us the virus, right? And we all know that masks are supposed to limit covid particles in the air and protect our mouths and noses from coming into contact with them. But what about our eyes?? I had this thought a while ago and then looked it up and it’s actually true. If you walk through a section of covid particles at the store or where ever, your mask may protect half of your face, but it’s completely possible for the particles to get in your eyes and infect you. I don’t understand why this isn’t talked about more. People need to be wearing glasses or some sort of protective gear."
"Am I the asshole to call off a guy that got too close to me when I was working out? I woke up extremely  sore today, yesterday around 9 pm I went to the gym and I got surrendered by three people insulting me. For my workout I set up my weights in the middle on the space like rectangle and it was nobody around that time. Minutes later, I saw 2 guys and a girl working out passing close by the weights I set up, so I waited until they stopped kinda on the corner of that rectangle space, then  I started to work out with the weights. While working out I was wearing a face mask the whole time, one of the guys didnt care to pass too close by me, right away I called him off telling him “keep distance or wear a mask”, the girl jumped on me saying “we were here first, we dont have to wear a mask” and I replied, “if you were working out than close then you should” and the other guy started to insulte me the F word and that is when I got really upset, I dont usually insult people when I am upset, just yell probably (I have very clean vocabulary). I am little girl 5’2 and got surrounded by three people (the guys were big around 6’ or more) when the issue was with one of them. There was a plenty of space around that rectangle area, but they didn’t bother to move further of me, it makes really upset to think how people could be so careless and selfish 😞 . I have no family in this country (Canada), and I haven’t seen friends in months and the last thing I want is to take the chance to get sick while I am alone here. Sorry for my grammar mistakes, English is my second language!"
My mom was tested positive for that stupid virus. She doesn't feel anything right now other than the loss of smell and taste.
"I lost my sense of smell and taste back in May or June for 3 weeks. Now, I smell certain scents and it doesn't go away. For example, I smelled a certain cleaning product and all I could smell all the time was that cleaning product. Last weekend, I had dumplings from a restaurant and now all I ever smell is that ginger sauce or whatever it is that came with the dumplings, like I smell it right now and all day long. Another time, all I could smell is my shampoo all the time. I can still smell all scents, but then it goes right back to that scent that is stuck. Ex, if I smell my perfume right now, when I am done smelling it, it'll go back to that ginger sauce that I had from the dumplings last weekend. Can anyone explain this? This has never happened to me before so I think it's from covid but not sure."
Why is testing free in big cities but cost $175 in low-income areas for people without insurance? I'm dying over here...
"I work hospice and they are making us sit bedside with +pts for 12 hrs at a time. This already made me uncomfortable and I have expressed my concerns to the bosses. The final straw was tonight after spending all last night in a home with +pt and the fam was all + as well. Work was going to send me to a new pt tonight that wasn’t infected yet. I didn’t refuse my assignment but did express my concern about the family being informed they could potentially be exposed. Work called and started to chew me out because “if you had a mask on you were not exposed and you can’t tell the family anything dew to hippa”.  Long and short I called in I haven’t been fired yet but fully expect to be because I’m against putting others at risk with out at least telling them. Ok rant over now time for my questions for you all.        Can some one pls help me understand the difference between exercise exposure vrs prolonged exposure. Also to those of you that work health care, how long do you spend in a room with +pts on average. Am I the only one that thinks this is a problem?"
"Every single website says isolate for 10 days after end of symptoms. I started feeling sick last Wednesday night. Thursday morning woke up with a fever and again Friday. After Friday no fever, body aches disappeared and the most I’ve sort of felt was like I had a cold since then. I’m curious 1. How long do I need to wait to stop isolating. 2. I have two roommates that I live with. They’re staying at their boyfriends right now but I’m having trouble finding information on what products to use to clean the house and how best to clean the house. Do I need to throw out the ice in the freezer and wipe down the whole fridge? Do I need to reclean dishes that have been air drying?"
"So I was just in a little antique store and there was this old lady who had a tag on her shirt that said ""I am covid immune and am not required to wear a mask"". Is this legitimate? Because I feel like it's not."
" We have someone in our family, who I won't name for obvious reasons, who is a brilliant nurse, very much on the frontline in intensive care in a local big hospital.  When people offer their conspiratorial angles on the Covid situation - and others are tiring of the Governmental constrictions placed on their lives.....  Do I listen to them?  Wondering if they can't see mum/brother/sister for Christmas - or do I listen to somebody who has seen many people die because of our selfish attitudes to want to ""carry on as normal""?  It's not a myth or a conspiracy, it's a medical fact. Don't believe social media nonsense, that sell you an alternative reality. Those keyboard warriors haven't seen Covid sufferers die in front of their eyes.  Pleeease people. If we just suspend normal interactions for a few months, and yes, just moderate our behaviours for just a few months more, we will save many thousands of lives.  Just think about ""us"" rather than ""me"". Even if you think you aren't high risk, think about how you could be a carrier for others that are more high risk.  It's a community effort. You may not be high risk but if you carry on regardless, you may unwittingly kill somebody you don't know.   But, more likely -  someone you do.... . 📷"

"Here is a story about a state representative from Gillette Wyoming, that actually died from Covid-19 on the day of / night before the election.  He was running unopposed and would have continued to be one of our representatives.  If you read what the son says about him, it gives you a real good look at how people feel in Gillette (“I’d rather die from Covid than not have my freedoms”)During a memorial service this weekend, former state Rep. Roy Edwards’ son Mitch confirmed that his late father was positive for COVID-19 when he died last week.Edwards died Nov. 2 at Wyoming Medical Center in Casper after being hospitalized for more than a week with what was an undisclosed illness at the time.He had been vocally opposed to public health orders regarding COVID-19 throughout the pandemic and while campaigning for reelection. He was reelected to his seat in the state House on Election Day, the day after he died. Edwards had experienced minor symptoms at first, but was told by a medical professional that he had sinusitis, was not symptomatic of COVID-19 and did not need to be tested. Although he was not advised to quarantine, he did so as a precaution, Mitch said.But later in the week, Edwards' symptoms worsened. When he had trouble breathing Oct. 23, he again sought medical attention, according to the livestreamed service.“My mom took him to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with COVID pneumonia and transported to the Wyoming Medical Center in Casper,” Mitch said during his father’s memorial service Saturday.After initially responding well to treatment, his condition suddenly worsened, Mitch said.“Roy believed that COVID was real and that it was serious, but at the same time he was critical and outspoken of policies that shuttered people’s livelihoods, resulted in husbands being kept from their wives and children being kept from their parents and loved ones being apart,” he said.As of Monday morning, there have been 1,474 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Campbell County along with 124 probables and 861 active cases, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Of the 114 COVID-19 related deaths in Wyoming, five were from Campbell County.Several officials in Campbell County also have contracted COVID-19 and have had to quarantine because of it.A COVID-19 outbreak at Central Baptist Church in Gillette, where Edwards attended, resulted in cancelled services and meetings in late October, about the time Edwards was taken to the Wyoming Medical Center. “This is the last thing I want to do, but given our situation and the amount of people with COVID or exposed to COVID, I feel it’s a necessity,” Pastor Scott Clem said on the church’s Facebook page about the outbreak at his church.Clem has not responded to numerous messages from the News Record in the past two weeks.One member of the church Edwards attended said that he was a greeter there who commonly shook hands with churchgoers as they entered each Sunday.His son said during his memorial service that Edwards first had symptoms Oct. 18, but did not attend church that day as a precaution.“Even in death, I’m positive that Roy would not have changed his views in opposition to government mandates or shutdowns,” Mitch said. “Whether others may have agreed or not, his advocacy for individual liberty and individual responsibility would have remained strong.”Edwards responded to questions from the News Record before the August primary election criticizing shutdowns related to COVID-19, expressing what he said was a danger to American freedoms.He said that all businesses should have been allowed to stay open and believed that only the sick should have to be quarantined. He also opposed mandated mask wearing.“The governor’s asking everyone to wear masks is wrong,” he said. “This is against what even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends. Even doctors are divided on wearing masks.”His political life began in Campbell County as a member of the Gillette City Council, where he served for 12 years. In 2002, he was elected to the Campbell County Commission, a position he held for eight years.The GOP precinct committee people in House District 53 will be charged to select three finalists for Campbell County commissioners to choose from to replace Edwards.“He told my mom that he’d rather die of COVID than live and die in fear,” Mitch said."

"I know this may sound like a silly question but for some of us who know how shady the government can be, and are hoping for help with unemployment it has to be asked.Is the government waiting to agree on a stimulus package in hopes of a cure so they don't have to help the people by paying out. Basically trying to be greedy and just keep pushing it back further and further.I say this because they have taken I'd say at least 2 vacations longer than a week each after ""talks"" for only like 2 or 3 days. I'm assuming they are hoping for more businesses to close. More people to maybe find a job. And a cure to be found. Anything to keep that money and get a nice fat bonus in their pockets. Who knows. Maybe I'm wrong about them getting a bonus but there's plenty they are not telling us.1. It shouldn't take this long for a decision..2. They put out a stimulus before before Jun when there was only 70k people a day being covid positive. Now we have over 180k a day. Which in a week may be over triple the summer numbers.3. I know for a fact they ain't stupid and they see the people suffering and the numbers growing substantially. So the fact they don't want to help is rediculous and sounds a lot like greed to me.4. If they don't do something soon, enough people will lose their homes, family and lives because they couldn't make enough to keep it all together that there will be a civil war.I am looking for agreements and people who do believe the same. I don't need sugar coated answers but facts, truths and for information to get out to those who are suffering so they don't keep depending on a government who is more concerned with money and trump (who's lost) still fighting and taking up real news time for what matters. If you disagree with anything said. Let me know but use facts, not beliefs if you got them. I can't stand the fact That this shit has gotten so ugly because of the stupidity and greed of men. I luckily had savings but they won't last forever. Just got to hope virus gets to a point where the government can't ignore it anymore. I wouldn't doubt if it's over 300k or more a day cases and over 3k deaths a day before this ""unknown vaccine"" comes out to help. With unknown side effects. The vaccine relies on MRNA which has been tried and failed every single time in the past. Now all of a sudden they figured out how to make it work.. That's not something I trust without enough clinical trials and am not putting my faith in it right now to fix this situation or help pay peoples bills. It is time the government does its job and helps those who have kept this country running for a very long time.Sorry for the rant there and here but these things piss me off and I don't like to see people suffer when the government should have had plans in place for this type of situation. In 50 years when minimum wage is $30 an hour and all those making minimum wage who voted to increase it everytime realize that it just increases cost of living everywhere else to balance it out except worse. And no one can pay 4500 in rent every month for a 2bed place. This country will go to hell. I can't believe Biden wants to raise the minimum wage again as all it's gonna do is ruin this country more. But hell. I guess as long as I am stable before it does. It'll be on future generations to deal with. Good luck to everyone cause we are in for a hell of a ride and hope you prepare yourselves."
"Of all the people in our family we were trying to keep away from COVID, it would be my dad. He was diagnosed on Wednesday. Started with dry cough, runny nose, congestion, fever, GI symptoms for two days. Fever and GI symptoms went away Friday, Saturday, most of Sunday then came back at 100.8 and has upset tummy but no nausea. Fever is going down now after an hour of 100.8. He can eat but not as much. He still has taste/smell. I am scared for him. He’s at his home with my mom. They are in separate living areas so there is very little chance of transmission to mom. I just needed to say this. Thank you for reading."
I consider myself to be a calm passive person. Knowing that very few people stop when running up a mountain. But recently I have a somber feeling of disillusionment as the people in the world somehow have become increasingly changed as if the time has changed and people have become somehow isolated transfused in some web. To put in simple terms they have lost there shit. And I alone have kept my own sanity. Does anyone else notice this ?
"I’d like to start off by saying that I’m absolutely in favour of restrictions and that I do not think it’s wise to flout rules to make yourself feel better. I’m not advocating that we suddenly ditch social distancing at all. I grew up in a family that isn’t very touchy or affectionate at all. I grew up to become the opposite of that. I’m not necessarily overbearing, I just love nothing more than a hug from a friend or holding hands on a date. Touch is something I’m missing a lot right now. I’ve always struggled with winter and so I used to make the effort to see friends as often as I could to chase away the blues. I miss that so much. All the traditional dances that usually happen in my country during the winter months are cancelled. I can’t have my friends over to sit squished together on the couch or curled up on a mattress on the floor for film night. We can’t all sit elbow to elbow around the tiny dining room table for Christmas dinner. I can’t hug them goodbye or sit next to them or show any kind of physical affection. I just miss touch. We can still meet up for walks and we can still study together in the library but it’s just not the same. Social distancing measures will probably be the last restrictions to go and I’m really struggling to come to terms with that. I didn’t expect to miss touch this badly. I just needed to get this one off my chest. Stay safe folks."
no this is a disaster clearly! and if u recover u can have lifelong problems. come the fuck on people. the government has to make it work so that everyone is provided for WHILE being able to stay home. I dont care if people think that’s socialist. i’m tired of the politics!!!
"My symptoms fluctuated throughout my 3 weeks. They were the following:-Fever: 103F-Difficulty Breathing-Chest Pain-Headache-Chills-Muscle Aches-Fatigue-Loss of Taste-Loss of SmellI contracted Covid-19 on April 29, 2020 and completed quarantine symptom free May 19, 2020. Today is November 24, 2020 and I still have prolonged symptoms. They are the following:-Chest Pain-Partial loss of taste-Headaches/Migraines.Anyone else still have symptoms long after they completed quarantine?"
"I’m not sure how to stop this, so I thought I would go here for help. My cousin loves to travel. He probably spends about 2 months in a different part of the world every year. He just flew to Arizona a week ago, and apparently, HE KNEW HE HAD A FEVER AND COUPDNT TASTE ANYTHING! He plans to fly back tomorrow, WHILE STILL VERY SICK WITH COVID! I have no idea how to stop him. Our family has called his family saying he had no right to travel, which then was followed by them yelling at us for 30 mins. Is there any way I can contact the airlines so that the people sitting near him on the plane there know they may be infected, and so that he doesn’t travel back infecting more people?"
"Hi everyone! I wanted to provide the Reddit community with my experience of COVID-19. Right now, if you don’t feel like you’re experience symptoms as you felt a week ago, quarantine and get tested. Covid has been showing to have long term effects on the body physiologically and psychologically. In early November, my 21 year old brother was “living his best post quarantine” by going to LA mansion parties, hooking up with covid positive girl’s in his Mercedes and hanging out with his friends all over LA. He doesn’t go to college or seek higher education because it doesn’t interest him, but a combination of entitlement, pride and ego make him believe he can give out medical advise and expect 100% factual respect. He works full time at Walmart. Meanwhile, I’m prenursing and public health major and training as an emt. But, he wants everyone to take and respect his word without any knowledge, experience or work cited (He doesn’t know work cited means). In the middle of November, he started experiencing “mild flu symptoms”. He told everyone it’s not a big deal. Don’t stop yourself and let yourself he stopped hanging out with his friends or going to famous tik tok parties oh no. He kept going until he tested positive. The first thing he said after testing positive is Walmart is paying him two week pay. Now, he spends his time gaming 24/7 until he has to go back to work. Now, at the ending of November, my whole family tested positive for covid 19. This includes my mom, my grandma, my sister, her two kids, her husband, my brother, myself and my boyfriend. Furthermore, he spread and infected all of his friends and hookups. He takes zero responsibility and accountability of his life choices that potentially could kill anyone. If my grandmother dies, they lose my grandmothers house and everyone becomes homeless. My trump supporter mother dismisses my sister and I plead of house rule reform. She says we’re over reacting and I quote, “big cry babies over a little flu”. Mam, you are a stay at home mother since you graduated continuation high school (the continuation high schools aren’t bad nor dismiss ones efforts to seek education and climb the ladder. however my mother never gave a shit about school and ended up having to go to a school because she failed regular hs without any hardships, disadvantages or medical conditions). Now, I have to face giving my boyfriend COVID-19. My boyfriend comes from a very, very successful family background of doctors and business people in Thailand. I am now frowned upon as part of the covid problem in America. I look careless and uneducated in their perspective, especially since I’m a nursing major and a public health major. Now, my boyfriend and I are having relationship issues. I did not do my best to stay away from my brother. In the beginning of covid, my boyfriend directly told me my brother is at high risk. I didn’t listen and respect his boundaries, work, life and health condition. If my boyfriend didn’t love and care for me as much as he does, he would have broken up with me. I am not here to argue with anyones entitlement, life privilege and doctors impersonations- Im explaining how one person’s actions and dictate and alter others lives over ones selfishness and uneducated opinions. Peoples lives aren’t uneducated peoples toys and opinions. Everyone- stay in quarantine for the next few weeks from friends and families."
"I recently got a Covid test and an antibody test. My Covid test came back negative. My IGM levels came back as 0.0, but my IGG levels are 1.417. This was marked as high on my results. What does this mean?"
"My mom is one of the most delightfully inappropriate people you would ever have the pleasure to meet. Our doctors had that pleasure when we got tested for COVID last week. First of all, my heart and hat goes out and off to all the people in the medical field working tirelessly day in and day out trying to make the world a safer and healthier place. These people have been through a lot. And my mother, bless her heart, is going to give them more. Right before they shove with love the swabs up our noses, we notice a gentleman seated in the car next to us. He is going first. We try to invade his privacy by seeing his reaction when the swab enters his cranium, but the doctor is blocking our view. As soon as the doctor moves after the McSwabbing, we see him wipe tears from his eyes. We both go, “Fuck.” Seeing a grown man wipe tears from his eyes is not exactly the jolt of confidence we need for the impending swab-a-dub-dub. Of the two of us, I am easily the braver. Low bar, people. I am not a brave person, but when it comes to needles, heights, closed spaces, and general human interaction, I feel like Superman compared to my dear sweet mother. The kind doctor rolls his kit over to my side of the car and asks us who wants to go first. Wow. I should have kept my mouth shut. I volunteered. This doctor and his beautiful, gentle eyes reassure us that this process, although uncomfortable, is momentary. He tells me to relax my face. My immediate response, along with listening by relaxing my face, is my mom won’t be able to do this. She cannot relax especially when people tell her to. I let my face go. He shoves this swab up to give my brain a tickle. I feel my eyes start to water from the sting. My mom notices. And she goes audibly, “Oh, fuck.” She knows I have a higher pain tolerance than her. She knows she’s screwed, and she should have gone first. The doctor now fully understands the type of patient that awaits him. He oozes mastery and care as he slowly rolls his kit to the other side of the car like a zoo keeper about to feed the wild cats. Fear has penetrated my mother. She is immobilized in it other than her mouth which is working perfectly. She dropped so many f-bombs before the doctor had even unravelled a new swab. She was throwing them at him with such precision and velocity. All I could do was sit there and lie to her face that it wasn’t so bad, and she should probably stop cursing the nice people doing their job. She doesn’t mean to be obtrusive. She’s just really bad at leaving her comfort zone. Her time has come. She tilts her head back. The dreaded word “relax” exists on the doctor’s lips. Her face immediately tenses. The swab goes up, up, and away as she rips this kind doctor a brand new butt hole. She is desperate now. You can tell the doctor wasn’t expecting this big of a fight. Like it’s clear he’s gonna win, but not unscathed. At this point, the nurse assisting him is shaking. You can’t see her smiling (mask), but she is going home with a golden egg of a story. And so am I. The doctor releases my mother from the clutches of the swab. The relief is shortly lived with the initial sting follows. I counted at least a dozen “fucks” unilaterally delivered. And from a woman who claims she doesn’t have any, she sure shared a plethora to our dear sweet doctor. We thanked them from their service. My mom apologized. The best part of this story is how well the both reacted to my mother’s not-so subtleties. They thanked us. Which sounds so wrong. Thank god we were in the privacy of our own cars and not near children. Just a reminder of how deep humanity is when push comes to shove. And shove with love cuz that brain is getting scratched. Take care, everyone."
"Hi,&amp;#x200B;As thanksgiving celebrations on both sides of my family draw nearer, I am faced with this internal conflict of going or not. I'm an 18 year old US citizen and expected to participate in these events to a large decree as not going would be a huge disappointment to both families. Last night my brother, father and I had an argument over allowing my grandparents, who are high risk to the virus, to attend the holiday. Things got pretty heated as they are right-leaning while I am the polar opposite, so our arguments struck down to fundamental levels. After the argument ended, I came to a final conclusion: If I find out my grandparents are attending this holiday, I don't want any part of contributing to their risk. I won't go to either. It's worth noting that they are not practicing any of the guidelines suggested by medical professionals across the nation such as open windows, mask wearing, distant tables etc. &amp;#x200B;I'm asking for any insight to this situation or perhaps any path that may be less disappointing as this one. Thanks in advance."
"Did you know that those masks with vents on them do nothing to prevent the spread?  I want to enforce that nobody can wear these inside the store than I manage but I guarantee it'll be an escalation for most customers.  Imagine telling a customer that probably doesn't know, the ""mask"" they're using doesn't help others around them.  They'd think ""its a mask, your sign says to have a mask, and this is one... I drove 30 min"" etc.  Very frustrated that our leadership does nothing to educate the masses.  So remember... if you see someone with a mask with a vent, or vents on it - its basically the same as if that person wasn't wearing one."
"I have white cell lymphoma cancer and think the symptoms of covid (breathing trembling) today, I have been tested and want positive for hospitality and do not let me out of the hospital. The thing is that I'm 14 years old and I'm with my grandmother in the United States because we only have dual nationality and I have family living elsewhere, I have chemo on Friday and tomorrow it's rest and then my grandmother plans to go after there with my family, I'd rather die than catch my family, my grandmother has been coughing and says it's dust, but I don't believe her , I don’t care about me, just the happiness of my family and I can't tell my grandmother that I want her to do the test because she thinks she doesn't have symptoms and is very happy because today at the conference the doctor gave new news that my cancer treatment is working very well and my family is also very happy with that and because they think I'm going to go with them, but I just don't want to spread them."
"Shouldn’t the vaccine be for people who haven’t gotten Covid19, since it’s for them to make antibodies... Isn’t that how vaccinations and immunity work? If you already had Covid then why would you get vaccinated?"
"I've heard a theory that wearing a mask can reduce viral load(or the 'dose' of the virus you may contract from aerosols or droplets) and thus results in a less severe experience. Of course, it would not apply to everyone, but is there some truth to it?I started experiencing symptoms on Saturday. Got a test yesterday so won't get the results for awhile. I have 2 coworkers who tested positive and work on a campus where 50 students tested positive in the last 5 days. So I certainly would not be surprised if I have it. However, I'm surprised by how manageable it is considering that I have an autoimmune condition. I also get sick easily and everytime I've gotten the flu in the past(including 3yrs ago), it was absolutely brutal. With this, I had 2 relatively bad days(still coughing quite a bit)but I didn't feel like I wanted to die.Seems the difference between now and every past illness is that I've faithfully worn a mask and socially distanced. I'm wondering, could it have been worse if I had not done these things?"
"My roommate is an Italian, and she went back to Italy in early November and planned to come back here in PA early December. But she refused to do a COVID-19 test for some unknown reasons and insisted to do the 14 days quarantine. I'm her only roommate and our apartment has a shared bathroom. Additionally, I'm a type 1 diabetes patient who has been shown to have a higher risk of getting a worse outcome if I'm infected. I don't know what should I do under this condition? Should I contact her advisor or the professor who is in charge of the COVID-19 issues?"
"I don’t know what to do. I’m sitting in my room with my jacket on and my keys in hand with a plate of 50 deviled eggs and i can’t bring myself to get out the door. When i told my ma i was freaking out, she said “well you can live your life or be scared forever”. I’m a 37 yr old man with two plates of eggs just crying cuz i miss my mom and can’t go see her without having a panic attack.Edit: ma just texted and apologized told me she loves me, and that she just misses me and lashed out. She’s a good lady. We’re all just human. She said we can see each other next week in a smaller setting. I just needed somewhere to rant. Thanks."
"For anyone who needs to hear this, you’re not in this alone. It can happen to anyone, anywhere and you need to be strong if you’re going to get through this. For yourself and for the people waiting for you outside of your room. I (30, M) consider myself as someone who takes reasonable precautions in public these days and have done so since the pandemic started. I still have no idea where I caught the virus from. It....just happened. I started feeling an itch in my throat which the next day turned into a full blown flu type of scenario. Runny nose, stuffed sinuses and a fogged up head. Like it felt I had a 5 lb weight on my head, which was strange. I got tested two days later and found out the day following that I was positive. I live in a house with 3 other people. All tested positive as well since they had been around me. My wife (23,F) and I lost our sense of taste and smell. She had a mild fever, while I suffered from seriously inflamed sinuses. Like it hurt to just breathe. My dad had no symptoms and my mom had cold &amp; flu symptoms for 3 days. I had it the worst, but none of the severe symptoms for which I cannot be thankful enough. We were lucky. Very lucky. We realize that 100%. Ive read stories of guys in their 30s dying just weeks ago who seemed otherwise perfectly healthy. I’m overweight and not in the best of shape in any sense. Stay strong and stay safe. Care for those in need and be kind to each other. Every day we have in this world is a blessing. Love you all."
"I got home Wednesday, didn't have much food in the house so I called around trying to find someone who would be willing to drop off something at my house. I was recommended to this one church in town. Oh that was a mistake. Covidiot central right there, instead of a food delivery this woman and two men showed up pounding on my door demanding I let them in. They were spouting Covid19 hoax conspiracy nonsense and demanding I prove to them that I was infected. It was nearly an hour of shouting before they left, saying they'll come back with proof its all a hoax.County cops won't come out because I have Covid, so I am on my own here. I admit I am halfway tempted to just spit in their faces should they return, but if they infect others and someone dies it be my fault.  Only good thing that has happened today is a older woman in her 80's learned I have Covid and needed food just stopped by. Her and her family fixed me up a plate of food and she brought it to my doorstep. She was wearing a mask, she talked to me through the door and wished me well. I have no idea who she is, I wish there were more people like her."
"I am furious man, I work at Dunkin and I was taking care of the window when a woman comes to the window. I say “are you feeling alright?” when she hands me her debit card, and she asks one more time what I asked. I respond “oh I’m sorry, I just said are you feeling alright because the casual response to how are you is good, where as if you ask if someone’s feeling alright it hits more, at least for me it does.” I slide the chip of the card into the pad thing, and she says “oh. Well no I’m not alright, I’m actually dealing with Covid. Not that I have it, but I deal with people that have it.” That’s when I look up and see her visually obvious fever with red all over her face. When she left I washed my hands as thoroughly as I could, but no, a few days later an older crew member gets diagnosed with Covid, and later I lose my breath easily, and then it continued to get more evident to right now, where I can no longer sleep because my lungs feel like they’re being hung. I’m quarantined at the moment, doing what I can to protect others.IF YOU HAVE A FEVER DO NOT COME INTO A DRIVE THRU OR RESTAURANT, YOU ARE RISKING NOT ONLY THE PERSON SERVING YOU, YOU ARE PUTTING EVERYONE THAT ORDERS COFFEE AT RISK!!!"
"Trigger Warning: Suicide, Death, Illness, Bad Language.A lot of people are going to think I'm a cunt for this and I really don't care anymore. I'm in my adult years (not 18 years old but not 50 years old either) and my whole life I've been afraid of hurting people's feelings. My anxiety, which I've had my whole life, has always led me to think, ""I could be the difference between whether or not this person hangs themself this evening."" Now, I know I'm not that important. I just figure, if I'm going to speak to someone, I'd ought to be kind and be the type of person that doesn't dwindle away at another's faith in humanity. I have a background in stand up comedy (side gig/hobby, not my full-time job) and EVEN THEN, while telling JOKES, I did what I could to not offend anyone, even if it meant sacrificing a great joke (which is a whole other rant on its own). However, this year I've really seen the general population for what they are, selfish assholes. Now you can take one of two routes right now, get offended because the shoe fits or hear me out because you understand my plight. I know not EVERYONE is a selfish asshole, but today we're gonna talk about the good handful that are. Normally I keep this to myself because the world doesn't need more negativity, but I'm locked down with a Covid diagnosis so here we are. &amp;#x200B;I understand that 2020 has been a shitty year. I've actually been far more lenient than I thought when it comes to understanding people wanting to see their families or gathering with their friends. In my opinion, if you're doing it safely and not doing it every fucking day, then there is little to no problem. You just need common sense (which I understand is not so common, but you get my point). Some people have chose to completely lock down, which I understand (it's also the smartest thing to do if you can do it) and some people have chosen to go out every once in a while, which I also understand. One thing I will never understand is the fucking mask. If they don't work then why the fuck do doctors wear them when they're operating on you?! I'm an essential worker and I'm asymptomatic. I won't tell you what led me to get tested in the first place because then I'd have to divulge too much information. The people I work beside everyday didn't fucking get Covid because I was wearing the mask!!! Hello! I bet you're glad I was ""giving into the new world order"" now. &amp;#x200B;Here comes the part where you're going to think I'm a bitch and truthfully, I don't give a fuck anymore. There's no medical exemption to the mask. I'm sorry, there's not (I'm willing to admit that there's probably 0.01% of the world population who needs a mask exemption. I'm sure there are conditions that exist where you can't wear it and I'm not talking about you. If anything, you probably can't stand the anti-maskers as much as me). I know myriads of people with medical issues (ranging from asthma, having one lung altogether, terminal illness, chronic illness, autoimmune disease, COPD, etc.) and PTSD who wear the mask everyday, for their whole work shift (9+ hours). They're fine. I know you probably bitched and bitched until your doctor had to write you an exemption (because, by law, they have to help you and if you sit there and tell them you're gonna ""pass out"" or something, they have to write it), but the fact of the matter is, you can wear one and you're choosing not to because you value your comfort over other people's safety and that's that. Die angry about it. If you're one of these people, don't even bother commenting on this because it's pointless.  It's uncomfortable for me to wear one because I'm a dumbass who decided to start smoking at 15 years old. That's my fault. I'm wearing the mask anyway and I'm never going to ask for fucking sympathy because I messed up my body. And I'm sure the mask is not comfortable for those who were born with asthma or other conditions and I actually have sympathy for them. They wear it anyway. Being asymptomatic is not as rare as it was once thought to be. The only reason it is safe to go out every once in a while, like I mentioned before, is if we're not spreading it. So wear the mask. &amp;#x200B;And to anyone who got this far and is about to comment, ""if people have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ disease, then they just shouldn't go out."" Gooooo fuck yourself. So because someone has COPD they shouldn't be able to buy fucking groceries? Or go into public? Because the mask is uncomfortable for you?! YOU shouldn't go out. YOU'RE ""affliction"" is an opinion, their affliction isn't. YOU'RE the one potentially spreading it, therefore YOU'RE the problem. Just because someone has a medical condition, doesn't mean they deserve less of a life in ANY regard. It's not going to kill you to sacrifice 30 minutes of optimum comfort in a grocery store. Start thinking about how the person next to you in the aisle may have already fought for their life. They don't need something as mundane as going to the grocery store or gas station being a threat to their health or life. &amp;#x200B;With that being said, I wish everyone happiness and health, even if you are the type of dumb fuck to not wear a mask (not only because if you get sick, everyone else probably will, but because I truly don't want anyone getting sick or dying). If you're angry right now, it's because the shoe fits. If you understand what I'm saying it's probably because you have loved ones who could die, or maybe you work in healthcare or maybe you have a career where you have to talk to the public constantly, etc. I don't wish ill on anyone. I just made it the whole year without turning into a vicious bitch about it and my time is up. I'm confined to a 10x10 room in my home because I can't risk getting the other person who lives with me sick. I wore my mask but it only works one way. Blessing to you ALL, even if I'm angry with some of you.TLDR: I think you're a stupid twat if you don't wear a mask but I still don't wish you harm. Blessings or health and happiness to everyone even if I'm pissed at you."
"My covid test results are still pending. But I’m pretty sure I have it.. Someone at my work I was in close contact with tested positive. We are essential workers. I came down with a sore throat the last four days and some congestion.THATS IT. But tonight I’m noticing my taste and smell is bland.. not completely gone but seems to be heading that way. I’m curious, was loss of taste/smell a later symptom for anyone? Everything I read says it’s one of the first symptoms. As of now I’m assuming I have a milder form of Covid if it is that.. let me know your experiences!"
"My entire family decided to gather for Thanksgiving and thats like around 30 people. I was confused why we even celebrate bc we're asian so like why. Any who, I had a screaming match with my mother two days before the event and she said covid isnt that bad and not everyone that gets it will die. Mind you this lady is immunocompromised and I feel like she forgets that. As I'm talking to her about the studies and lasting effects of covid recovery, she said I watched the media too much. (she watches Fox News all day so....) Honestly I've been out on picnics, outdoor museums, eating out in my car and just adapting to changes (social distancing and masks when necessary) without compromising anyone's health. So I told her I'm not going to thanksgiving dinner and that was the end of it. I stayed home alone while my parents went to the gathering. I planned on quarantining myself regardless bc I literally live in the same house so catching covid, if they had it, is unavoidable. TELL ME WHY, there will be another gathering AT MY HOUSE for my grandpa's death memoriam. I'm am frustrated, angry and just trying to hold it together because I've already started coughing but no fever and I really hope its just allergies BUT CMON PEOPLE! YOU CAN BELIEVE IN SCIENCE AND RELIGION EVEN THE POPE SAID DONT GATHER AND MY FAMILY IS CATHOLIC. someone please tell me something hopeful rather than thoughts and prayers because I cannot stand living here anymore."
"She works Covid-ICU every so often, and comes home a mess, her head and mind usually spinning because of the pressure. She has two critical care patients usually and sometimes three in MICU. As you nurses know, charting is a pain in the ass and takes away from you ""putting the patient first"". They are about to put four patients to each nurse soon in Covid ICU. Again, as you know, four patients during a day shift, 8 am charting, 10 min each or so, then again a few times a day. If you could chart at the end of the day, similar to giving report at day end, would result in ""better patient care"". I am asking that we put in a moratorium on the law suits during this time, it's only gonna get tougher, and as you know, again, the only reason for so dann much charting is to cover the ass of the hospital. I wish I could get someone to listen. I would do all I could to help you front line soldiers, aka nursing and doctors and respiratory therapists and all support staff. You are the rock stars. God Bless you all. Even though people are now forgetting you, know that.....I love you and thanks."
"Hey all. Looking for a little advice- I’ve been working at a restaurant for 15 years. We’ve been doing really well with COVID, but this week two staff members tested positive and one was inconclusive. I also work full time at a social services agency where I manage a food pantry. I sincerely do not believe that I had prolonged contact with either positive individual for 7+ days. My more pressing concern is there was someone else positive that may not have known and there could potentially be more positives than we know. Also- my main concern here are my coworkers at my full time job as we perform a lot of crucial services for seniors and people in need. I can easily get tested in the county I live in which may be my best route at this point and I probably will. Does anyone think my full time job can ask me not to work at the restaurant? I’ve been working there for a very long time and would feel very bad to leave them short staffed. Quite stressful!"
"Im curious to see what types of lifestyles, habits actually cause you to be susceptible, or if it doesnt matter at all."
Seeing as COVID keeps getting worse in the US. how likely is it that we’ll go into another lockdown?
"So the Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70°C and has to be used quickly once removed from the freezer. Hypothetically, if the government would have to keep the vaccine in the freezer as long as possible before injection, would it be dangerous to inject sub zero temperature liquids into the body?"
"I’ve been lucky in that loss of taste/smell, slight upper lung issues, and shortness of breath have been my only symptoms. I KNOW others have it so much worse than I. I truly do. However, the loss of smell is really starting to get to me. I’ve had such horrible dreams that my house burns down and my children die because I can’t smell the smoke. I’m going on 17 days. When did anyone else get taste and smell back? Did it come back gradually or all of a sudden?"
"But ITS AFFECTING EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE!!! My kids can’t go to school, I lost my job, I keep getting sick, and can’t tell if it’s covid, I’m out of remission, a bad cold, or my allergies are acting up. We can’t be near our friends.—just an FYI , when I say “We” , I’m referring to people all over.IT JUST SUCKS!!! I wanna think about other things, but life keeps getting more frustrating &amp; boring &amp; scary.....&amp;rly rly depressing"
"Online I keep seeing YouTuber, tiktokers, people on Instagram (u know all that BS) hangout ether making videos or taking pictures together. Is their some role In America that lets people do this? Because I haven’t lay a hand on someone not related to me in 8 and I’m beginning homeschooled.Idk it just seems a little weird Considering that I’ve been distancing this hole time doing my part just so some 21 year old can get drunk, it feels quite selfish I know it’s also in Canada a tun but they’re just braking the rules.I’d their something that says that 7 tiktokers from different states or country’s can hang out so they can shoot a 15 second dance video?"
"I am a physician fighting on the front lines of the COVID 19 pandemic. I am an internal medicine trained physician. For the past 4 1/2 years I have been providing care solely to nursing home residents in several nursing home facilities across the state of Connecticut. Most of the patients that I care for are immunocompromised and either have dementia or psychiatric illness.  Nursing homes have been the epicenter of the pandemic in this state.  As of yesterday we have lost over 5000 nursing home residents and staff.  We were blamed for poor infection control and poor care and for the multitude of deaths in our facilities. What the public does not know is the truth... not what the media tells you but the actual trust from the mouth of a seasoned physician that has borne witness to it all.  What I have seen in these past nine months, my eyes can never unsee.  In the beginning of this pandemic, I witnessed several facilities trying to cover up their outbreaks. When this all started Covid swabs were not even available to our patients and when they were some administrative staff were asking us to discard swabs and not send them to the labs.  When we were able to test, it was taking up to 10 days to get a result. Not to mention the fact that we did not have proper gear to protect ourselves or our patients. In an eight week span, I lost over 120 patients across the state. It was devastating and not something I ever imagined I would experience in my career or in my lifetime. Patients were sick and dying in our facilities.  They were unable to be united with family and many were scared because they did not recognize us in our masks and shields. During the height of the pandemic, our patients were denied services including radiology exams, routine laboratory services, and routine medical follow-ups. They were even denied beds in our hospitals and were sent to die in “COVID” tents.  With no approved treatment available at the time, we as clinicians had to have a tough discussions with the families. In a lot of cases we decided to keep the patient comfortable and allow them die peacefully and with dignity in our homes as we they were unlikely to survive the illness. And in the midst of all this, we were receiving guidance from our federal health agency and local officials to cover our mouthes to protect ourselves with scarves and bandanas.  Yet we went to work each day, tired and weary, to provide the best care for our patients only to have the media and these government agencies criticize us for the care that we were giving.  It was and is disheartening. I still lose sleep over this most nights. As numbers are on the rise again, we are starting to see the same patterns. Guidance is not strong and changes sometimes on an hour to hour basis. As staff get ill and can no longer care for our patients, our facilities are forced to close. Lab companies are again refusing to come and draw their blood work and transportation companies are again refusing to transport them to necessary appointments to keep them alive, including dialysis. Hospitals are being dishonest and are sending known Covid positive patients back to these facilities without informing us and causing a recurrence of outbreaks in our facilities. And yet complaints are fallen on deaf ears. As healthcare providers, we are angry and we are tired, yet we continue to fight for our patients. But in the end, it is the patients who lose. First, they lost their independence, then they were denied the ability to see their families, then they were denied admission to our hospitals, and now they are being denied the routine medical care that is needed to keep them alive. Some have paid the ultimate price with their lives and yet here we are stuck in the same spot that we were back in March and April.  Some think we have come so far, but the reality is, sadly, nothing has changed.

"More and more scientific research is coming out showing that the coronavirus has been spreading since mid-2019. I think that I had Coronavirus in October of last year. I developed a mysterious respiratory illness a little less than two weeks after traveling to Wisconsin for a Packers game. My husband finally talked me in to going to the doctor (I hate the doctor) because I couldn’t breathe. It was so bad I couldn’t wear a bra or a tight fitting shirt because it felt like an elephant was sitting in my chest. I almost collapsed on the short walk from my car to the office.They got me back immediately, strapped me in to a CPAP with Albuterol so I could finally breathe and tested for everything they could think of. They did a chest X-ray to make sure I didn’t have pneumonia. After a few hours, I was sent home with no actual answers and a prescription for a Z-PAC, more Albuterol and a steroid inhaler. I got better after about a two weeks.The mysterious “vaping” illnesses and deaths that began occurring in the late summer/fall of 2019, that many doctors say aren’t fully explained, began in the Midwest region where I had been traveling in August of that year. Strange how Americans had been vaping for 10 years before one death was linked to vaping, and then an outpouring of others occurred within weeks of this first mysterious death. Haven’t heard of any further “vaping” deaths since all this began. Was it really the vaping that was taking their lives? Or was their vaping a contributing factor to a mysterious illness that did the same? “The Taiwanese physician noted that in August of 2019 the US had a flurry of lung pneumonias or similar, which the Americans blamed on ‘vaping’ from e-cigarettes, but which, according to the scientist, the symptoms and conditions could not be explained by e-cigarettes. He said he wrote to the US officials telling them he suspected those deaths were likely due to the coronavirus. He claims his warnings were ignored.Immediately prior to that, the CDC totally shut down the US Military’s main bio-lab at Fort Detrick, Maryland, due to an absence of safeguards against pathogen leakages, issuing a complete “cease and desist” order to the military. It was immediately after this event that the ‘e-cigarette’ epidemic arose.”Oh I know, conspiracy theories abound. While I don’t think that the virus necessarily originated here, I do believe it has been here a lot longer than we all think.So, what are your thoughts? Do you think that you had coronavirus in 2019?https://bgr.com/2020/11/16/coronavirus-number-pandemic-started-earlier-than-we-thought/"
I’m scared for this winter. I work at an assisted living and one of my coworkers tested positive for covid. Tomorrow everyone will be tested for covid. We were doing so well; we didn’t have any cases. I don’t want my residents to die. I know of other places where half of their residents died from covid. I don’t want my residents to suffer from complications of isolation. So many high functioning people went to the dementia unit in the spring due to lack of socialization and movement. I’m also worried about my own family; we are all healthcare workers. My mom is a nurse and just started a new job at a busy hospital after being employed for 3 months. People need to stop being so selfish; it is already terrible again and it will continue to do so until the end of spring.
"&amp;#x200B;Here’s the simple, disgusting and unvarnished truth: the VAST majority of COVID-19 deaths were and are completely preventable. People aren’t so much being killed by a disease, but by politics and ineptitude. In fact, by *your* politics and your ineptitude.Look, nobody else is going to tell you this, but if civilization is to go on you need to hear this: There is nobody to blame but yourself. This entire disaster, from the dead people to the economic and social crisis is absolutely *your* fault.You were too lazy, too stupid and too cowardly to stop it.Tonight, your head is going to have to hit a pillow. If you’ve any shred of human decency left, any moral integrity of any kind, you’ll suck it up, screw your courage to the sticking place and read the rest of this. Most won’t, because most people’s brains turn off when struck with cognitive dissonance and/or guilt on this scale…not to be redundant (but doing so purposefully so it sinks in): they’re too lazy, too stupid and too cowardly.So if you’ve already stopped reading, fuck off and die, the rest of us don’t need you anyway. Go back to wearing your mask around your chin and thinking you somehow matter. \[Hint: ya don’t\].For the few brave or just morbidly curious souls willing to absorb well-deserve abuse and pain, what you’re going to read is a tragic tale in which you are the villain. Sorry about that, I didn’t set out my day today to hurt people’s feelings, but sometimes the most loving thing we can do for each other as human beings is to do just that.And this is going to hurt, because you are, in fact, guilty of mass murder. We all are. And yeah, I know that sucks to hear, but there it is.So, here we go, my intrepid brothers and sisters.· According to official *estimates*[***\[1\]***](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_ftn1), COVID-19 has killed about 300,000 Americans, and globally over 1.5 Million.· The vast majority (90%+) of these deaths were *medically preventable*, having nothing whatever to do with governments or doctors, at a meager cost of about $15/month per person, with a regimen virtually any person can do and items at can be obtained over the counter at Walmart and any farm-supply store: Tractor Supply, IFA, Cal Ranch etc. Plus, we’ve mostly known this regimen for decades now, but for sure we’ve confirmed specifically that this regimen will prevent most COVID-19 fatalities since roughly February 2020. The fact you didn’t know that until reading this is the simple, irrefutable proof that you’re lazy, stupid and cowardly. Because it was out there. Admitting that to yourself will be a very helpful step toward resolving this crisis.· We keep hearing that “COVID-19 is NOT the Flu”…and that is technically true, but what should *always* follow that statement is “But it should be.” Said another way, there is ZERO medical reason COVID-19 should be worse than Influenza in terms of being fatal for most people. That it is killing people at rates higher than the flu is on you, nobody else. COVID-19 is readily treatable, NOT requiring hospitalization and not requiring a vaccine. Hospitalizations, ventilators and vaccines are simply more evidence that you are lazy, stupid and a coward. Operation Warp Speed and vaccines are emergency last-resort measures that should never have needed to exist. It’s your fault that we need them, you could have solved this entire thing by the end of March. But you didn’t, and that’s on you, bud, nobody else.· Masks, Lockdowns, Social Distancing, etc are all proofs of your unmitigated and absolute failure. *It didn’t have to be this way*. You didn’t do enough. In addition to the dead, there are tens of millions of Americans unemployed, hundreds of thousands of businesses destroyed. Millions of students not getting an education, untold psychological damage to kids. All because you were…you guessed it…too lazy, too stupid and too cowardly.You still with me? OK, kiddos, so here’s the simple reality as to why this disaster is your (our) fault and also the recipe for solving it, not requiring emergency spending, not requiring vaccines. I mean, being totally honest it’s pretty much too late now, you already missed the boat on this one, but for NEXT time, assuming civilization goes on, here’s now to NOT fuck this up again, but this is also the fastest path back to ‘normal’ as you might think of it.Long before Sars-COV-2 existed, each of us could/should have taken the responsibility to fight it. I mean, it’s not like we didn’t know how. Let me give you a few simple hints here as to why NONE of us should have ever even heard of COVID-19…we never should have heard of it because it should never have become a deadly disease to humans, but we were too lazy or too stupid or too cowardly to have taken the simple steps to prevent it.i. You should have “prepared your terrain” to fight infections of this kind. Your terrain, in this instance, is your body…your body is basically a factory that can both produce more virus and can fight that same virus off (yeah, God really did a number on us, but you’ll have to take that dichotomy up with him). Preparing your terrain would have meant doing all the things we all know we’re supposed to do, but we don’t because… lazy, stupid, cowardly….let me throw out a few below just for kicks…ii. Don’t be fat. Utterly preventable COVID-19 comorbidity, obesity also major cause of most diabetes, also a major comorbidity.iii. Get good, regular sleep, especially 2-3 hours of sleep before midnight. Massive immunity booster against Coronavirus infections, [including SARS-Cov-2.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlbM6VVkVZM)iv. Don’t smoke, don’t abuse alcohol or drugs.v. Get regular, healthy exercise.vi. Wash your hands correctly and often.vii. Proper human beings know how to cough and, sneeze correctly. Politely and safely. If you don’t, it probably means you had terrible parents, but whatever, learn how to do it.viii. Take Vitamins D, C, Zinc, Quercetin, Melatonin (at night)ix. Upon suspected exposure to any virus (or any symptoms of viral infection show up in you), add Elderberry, Ivermectin and Aspirin until 2-3 days after symptoms abate.x. If you have symptoms of a viral infection, you should self-isolate…physically (“stay the fuck home”) and by wearing a mask when you must be around others, and you should contact a doctor and walk in with the MATH+ protocol in hand. No, admittedly most masks do not prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus from escaping, but they do reduce the larger droplet-based spread, which tends to have a higher viral load than aerosolized spread, and starting a new infection with a low inoculum (initial amount of virus) is important to allowing the immune system to mount a good fight. You should also inform those people with whom you’ve had close contact that you may have an infection so they can act responsibly and with proper knowledge that they might have been exposed.xi. If you’re older or have a pre-existing condition and there is a viral outbreak or viral infection risk, you should self-isolate, wear a mask, etc., and should take Ivermectin as prophylaxis even if you don’t suspect viral exposure. No, it’s not fair that because you’re older you have to do things that younger people don’t have to do. The question is how did you get to be old thinking life is somehow fair? It’s not, so suck it up buttercup. You are at greater risk, and also getting uglier by the day, that’s just how human life is. Can’t say it any plainer than that, just accept it and move on.So, there it is. The above regimen has been known for years to prevent viral infections (in general), and to prevent minor infections from becoming major ones, including the specifics of Coronavirus infections, and now confirmed over and over again to prevent the specific Sars-COV-2 virus and related disease COVID-19 from being fatal. The vast majority (I’m going to say 90%+ or so) of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented by each of us/you doing the above, and NONE of the above required a doctor, a hospital, a ventilator, a lockdown, or a vaccine, or any government policy.Plus, the sad truth is that all of the above have been known for years, based on scientifically studies, published and available to ANY of us/you at any time. A few Google searches and 20 minutes of reading and you'd have known all of that.You could have done the work to not be fat, but you were too lazy.You could have done the work to learn the [I-MASK+](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FLCCC-I-MASK-Protocol-v5-2020-11-28-ENGLISH.pdf) and [MATH+](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/FLCCC_Alliance-MATHplus_Protocol_v6-2020-11-12-ENGLISH.pdf) protocols and acted upon them, both pre-infection as prophylaxis, and post-exposure treatment, all on your own. You could have ensured your Doctor was aware of the I-MASK+ and MATH+ protocols, too – and yes, they SHOULD have done that work on their own, but since a huge part of defeating COVID-19 starts BEFORE you are sick enough to need a doctor, it’s still on you.Any medical care professional not currently proscribing Ivermectin to ANY suspected-SARS-CoV-2 exposed person is committing medical malpractice. I mean that was true months ago, [but it’s super duper true now. ](https://osf.io/wx3zn/) And that’s why Fauci et al are killers. Recommending masks and lockdowns but NOT advising people to take Vitamin D, Zinc, Elderberry, Ivermectin if high risk or suspected-exposed is malpractice, and the fact that you’re out there accepting this from our ‘authority’ figures makes you an accomplice.Yes, true, technically speaking Ivermectin is supposed to require a Doctor’s prescription for humans to take it, but it is available at any farm supply store (it’s used as a dewormer for horses), and it’s about $4 for enough to treat 6 people per the I-MASK+ and MATH+ protocols, and it comes in a tasty apple flavor.  If you are one of those people too scared to break these kinds of rules – well, remember that part where you’re a coward? Ivermectin kids, believe it.You could have taken Vitamin D, Zinc, etc. You could have gotten proper sleep (Melatonin), you could have exercised.Instead, you were too busy. You relied on ‘authorities’ like mass-murderer Anthony Fauci, who could have told you all to take Vitamin D and C and Zinc and Ivermectin. The fact that you relied on him or Donald Trump or any ‘authority’ structure is simply an excuse you’ve constructed for yourself to assuage your guilt at being lazy, stupid and that makes you a coward. If your excuse is that ‘nobody told me’ well fuck you, congratulations, your laziness (not doing the work yourself) and stupidity (being dumb enough to rely on some outside authority figure or structure) has resulted in 1.5 Million+ estimated deaths and Trillions of dollars in economic damage because policies ended up being implemented to make up for your laziness and stupidity.And that’s all true, and undeniable, but most of you will not have the bravery to admit it to yourselves.Stop falling back on the excuse of “The Government”. Here’s a hint for you kids in the back of the room: there is no such thing as “the Government” as some entity that is separate from you. Its you. You are the government. The Government is you, it is all of us, so when you’re saying The Government did this or that, you really mean you did this or that. Trump is your fault, Fauci, your fault and Biden/Harris, your fault too. Quit trying to blame others.But, You say, the Government didn’t have a plan or didn’t have enough hospital beds or didn’t have enough PPE for nurses?If you dumb fucks had been acting on the prophylaxis phase (and btw that phase is CONSTANT and NEVER ENDING) of COVID-19, by not being fat, sleeping more, eating right, getting exercise, taking Vitamin D, C, Zinc, Ivermectin, Elderberry…then we probably never would have even heard of COVID-19, because not enough people would have gotten sick and died for it to be a news story. You created the emergency that Governments were forced to respond to, not the other way around.That has NOTHING to do with Uncle Sam. This is on you, on us, on each of us, and until and unless you’re willing to admit that to yourself you’re still part of the problem and this is definitely going to happen again.It doesn’t matter if the virus came from a Chinese Lab doing Gain of Function research, or a “Wet” market or a bat or a pangolin or any of that. What matters is that you, yes I do mean *YOU*, could have done all of the things you should have been doing, all on your own, to prevent COVID-19 from becoming a global killer, but you didn’t.We didn’t.Most of us still aren’t.You’re wearing a mask? Fuck you, that’s a sign of failure…more it’s *proof* that we already failed, team. We’re at “100 Days of mask-wearing” and lockdowns as policies because you were already too lazy and stupid which is what enabled the pandemic to become a pandemic.COVID-19 is a very-treatable disease, it starts pre-infection and the protocol for curing it is known, available, cheap and for the vast majority of people, does not require a doctor, hospital or vaccine. And it sure doesn’t require lockdowns. But it does require you to pull your head out of our ass, to not be lazy and afraid.So, get out there, get this right, follow the I-MASK+ and MATH+ protocols and make sure your doctor is following them too. COVID-19 is beatable, and we could have reached herd immunity WIHTOUT a high fatality rate and never needing a vaccine or lockdowns or any of that. Either you’re willing to admit that to yourself or not.Good luck out there.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/submit#_ftnref1) The Government does NOT actually count COVID-19 deaths. They ESTIMATE deaths. Can you fucking believe that? Supposedly the worst disease in over 100 years, and Uncle Sam can’t even bring itself to actually tell us how many people it has actually killed. That is despicable and reprehensible. But you know what’s worse is that you fucking morons sit around and accept it. Until you read this, you didn’t even know this was the reality, did you? You see a “count” on CNN or Worldometer and just accept it as gospel. Why? Because you’re too lazy, too stupid and to cowardly. They weren’t hiding it from you, there is no conspiracy you use to mitigate your guilt or hide behind, it says so right on the [CDC’s website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm). They *estimate* flu deaths (every year), and they *estimate* COVID-19 deaths. Go ahead, go look, I can wait…. So no, nobody really knows how many people COVID-19 has killed in the US, it could be 300k, it could be 200k or 400k. And that’s your fault because you don’t demand it."
"Is anyone else experiencing stomach problems even after their covid went away? I still have diahrea, nausea, vomitting, and just a sensitive stomach all around. my doctor has prescribed by anti-nausea meds, and IBS meds. They have also scheduled a CT scan of my stomach for next week. and I am 4 weeks AFTER my positive covid test results."
"I quit over text after trying to get ahold of my boss by a phone call and she wouldn't answer. I know it's very unprofessional to do so. She knows I was sick because I apparently caught it from a co worker but she said I can still come into work. Anyway, she told me I could call or text her to let her know what I was doing, so I tried calling her but she didn't answer, so I sent her a text saying that I wasn't comfortable with the job anymore. They have positive cases there, she even said that workers still have to come to work even if they're sick with any of the symptoms. I may have even been exposed twice. I'm proud of anyone making the sacrifice but I'm just not willing to risk the health of myself or anyone around me. So, am I the asshole?"
" So my partner and I were planning on having her parents stay with us over Christmas and her BIL, his new GF and BILs son were going to come to spend Christmas day with us too.My partner and I are both diabetic so are at quite high risk and have been taking all of the rules very seriously. BIL on the other hand, has said from the very start, 'Covid isn't real', 'it's no worse than the flu', 'the country has been brainwashed' etc etc. He even said that we are being hysterical for being concerned about the extra risk we are at with our health condition.So, I sent a message to the group WhatsApp basically asking that in the week before Christmas could people try to limit time spent at places where they risk picking up Covid to keep us all safe so the little'n could have a great Christmas.Now, we do not feel we asked anything unreasonable and we did not set these as strict rules, just a request to keep us all as safe as possible.He responded by saying basically, 'we will carry on doing what we want and you can decide if you want us there'. Which has obviously upset us as he clearly values going to the gym or some shit over keeping everyone safe.He also said that they will be seeing his GFs family in the days before too. Now, in the UK that is against the rules as we are in tier 2 and they will be going inside GFs family's house. Even if they do this on the 23rd or 24th it would still be breaking the rules as the Christmas bubbles are fixed, you can't be a part of two different bubbles.So now MIL and FIL are getting involved saying that we are being childish making ""demands"" when we should have just spoken to BIL first. But he is beyond speaking to. He's one of these ones that is so convinced he is right that amount of reason will make a difference, you know the type.M &amp; FIL are saying that we need to compromise so that everyone can have Christmas together, but have made no effort whatsoever to speak to BIL and asking him to compromise. They're asking us what they are going to tell little'n, but it's not us they should be asking, they should be asking BIL. So we now have said that we are going to go to my parents instead and their response was 'well what about us?'. And we have basically interpreted that to mean that they only really care about somewhere to stay.BIL has never showed them any respect and has never had any respect for Covid rules, but M &amp; FIL are defending him adamantly saying that he has been ""reasonable"" in saying that he won't make any changes to keep us safe and it's up to us to uninvite him.So, are we the assholes here?"
Hello! I'm doing a high school project and wanted to ask if you could take this quick anonymous google form poll?     [https://forms.gle/q3KmjYxzSH4YFci37](https://forms.gle/q3KmjYxzSH4YFci37)

"I'm  a rideshare driver in south dacovid. My govenor tells people "" dont wear a mask! Dont let your kids wear a mask! Covid is fake news""!  I go to work every day because I need to keep a roof over my head &amp; feed my family. Every day I ask people to put on a mask before getting in my vehicle. I have been yelled at, cursed at, even threatened by anti mask ass hats. I've seen my perfect 5star rating drop because I DARED to make someone accept the free disposable masks that I buy out of my own money to give to people that dont have one. I am tired.  Yesterday though I had a passenger who exceeded all previous morons. I arrived to see my passenger waiting for me &amp; of course no mask. She tried to open my car door &amp; it was locked . She read the door sticker which reads "" no mask no ride"" she then walked to the drivers side window &amp; said "" do I have to wear a mask""? I said with a sigh , ""yes you do"" . She responded "" but I dont have one! Are you going to cancel &amp; leave me here?""   Out of frustration I did not offer her one of the disposables I keep in my car I just said ""yep"" &amp; put the car in gear to drive away. She yells "" wait! Dont leave !"" &amp; PULLS. A. MASK. OUT. OF .HER. POCKET!!!! To add insult to injury she goes on to tell me she is a PARAMEDIC. ON. AN. AMBULANCE . CREW . but the driver before me is a covid kristi/ trump lover &amp; as such does not himself wear a mask &amp; does not ask his passengers to wear a mask. She being a paramedic &amp; daily transporting covid patients to whatever hospital can find a spare bed does not wear a fucking mask. I'm heartbroken by this. I cannot believe that even here in south dakota a first responder would be that irresponsible. She put her life &amp; mine at risk because  she "" just doesnt like masks."" We are doomed."
So I’ve been arguing with a good friend of mine for months now about COVID. He says that there is little difference in infection/death rates in countries where “draconian” measures have been taken to control the spread of the virus and in those that have had little regulation. I know he’s wrong but I’m looking for some good resources to use to convince him. Anybody have anything they could share?
My boyfriend (26) informed me yesterday his brother was tested positive for covid. Him and his sister began feeling sick today. My boyfriend has the worst symptoms out of all of them. He’s having shortness of breath and could barely even talk on the phone. He’s vomiting and also has chills with body aches. I’m so worried about his breathing. He slept for a little and woke up because it got worse and is on his way to the ER right now. He smokes weed frequently and when covid came out i told him to stop because if he ever got covid things would possibly be worse for him. I’m so worried about his health. I hope he will be okay other than smoking he is healthy.
"I started having muscle pain. I assumed it was from working peak season. I normally work 3. 12 hour shifts now im working 5- 11 hour shifts. That's enough to make anyone sore. 2 days later I felt horrible, I knew I had covid. So I finished my shift went home to get a little sleep. I was going to go to the er ,I figured that would be the fastest way to get results. I called my insurance provider to make sure the hospital near me was in my network. They advised me to go to cvs because it's free with insurance. It took me another 3 days to get an appointment. That's 6 days before I was tested. Then 3 more days to get the results. I spent most of this time sleeping and trying to stay hydrated. I filed a covid claim with AMAZON HR and they advised me I needed some paperwork to prove I had covid. I finally received my results,to my surprise it was negative. I called Amazon HR explained what was going on. The lady said they definitely didn't want me going back to work with the symptoms I had. She told me I either took my test too early or too late to get a positive test results. Now im scrambling to prove I have covid or I'm either not going to get paid and or lose my job. I made a telemedicine appointment through my insurance and spoke with a nurse practitioner. She agreed I had covid but said she couldn't give me the ok to stay out of work. I am stressed out my daughter works with me and she's been out on a covid claim as well because she's around me so she most likely will get covid as well. If I don't figure something out we will be going 3 weeks without pay. This is why people don't stay home when they are sick. Some people can't go without pay. Why do companies make it so hard to get paid when you have covid. I get there are going to a small number of people who will take advantage of the paid 2 weeks off. But shouldn't a nurse practitioner hearing and seeing your symptoms be enough to get approved to be on a covid leave? Otherwise what's the point ? This has been the worst year ever. I pray next year will be better. I should have gone to the er instead of waiting. Trust your instincts, listening to someone else will get you screwed."
"So do you think it is true, that people who are dirty i.e never wear a mask, wash their hands, or take showers if not maybe a few times a week, immediately have the virus i.e. covid-19? Or do clean people carry it as well?"
So California is having roughly as bad a time with COVID as Florida has been in spite of the fact that Governor Newsome has imposed numerous measures to contain the virus while Florida has done relatively little. What explains this? Why are we on roughly equal footing given the wildly different strategies at play here?
"r/CovidSmell is a new subreddit for those who lost their smell and taste due to covid. It's mainly so you can share your experience if you lost your smell, so it can comfort others who are going through it. Even if you have regained your senses, feel free to share your experience, what you did to regain it, etc. So there is hope for others."
"My friends are being arrogant jerks about being told to self isolate, and aren't following the guide-lines at all. They're even planning to have a party and they act as if I'm the asshole for telling them not to do it. What can i do? I constantly keep on telling them and they just don't listen."
"Hi! \*\*I am hoping this is the appropriate thread to post this on, I am still fairly new to reddit and this is my first post.\*\*I saw a close friend on Sunday, 11/29, for about 3 or so hours, where we rode in the same car and decorated gingerbread houses. On Friday December 4th, a friend she last saw Saturday 11/28 told her that they tested positive for covid. Two days later, on Sunday night she started feel a sore throat coming on. She got tested Tuesday and is awaiting results. She now has congestion, fatigue, and a cough.My question is, have I been officially exposed? It's already been ten days since I last saw her and I feel pretty good, albeit, I think I am over-stressing myself into feeling slightly wonky when I think about this predicament. When I temporarily forget about this potential exposure, I feel fine. Part of me feels like this all in my head. Anyway. I wasn't told until Monday morning that she found out she was exposed on Friday and started to show her first symptom Sunday evening. (I'm actually so mad she found out her other friend has covid Friday and didn't think to tell me until Monday morning when I noticed she wasn't at work via Snapchat Maps and I had to fish all this information out of her about who, what, when, etc).Anyway, how likely was it that I was exposed to the coronavirus and might show symptoms in the next four days when the person I saw, was exposed themself 24 hours prior to seeing me? I am ten days post this 'exposure', so on Sunday the 2 weeks will be up. Do you think I may show symptoms in the next four days? Please and thank you for any responses. Stay safe! \*I am distancing myself from my family, by the way, even though they've clearly been exposed to me in the last week unfortunately.\*&amp;#x200B;edit: 12/10/20 - My friend tested NEGATIVE!"
"Hey friends!I am currently working at a major hospital in my area, and just received word I am eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as early as next week.I will be sure to keep you guys posted on how it is and if I have any reactions!Stay safe and healthy everyone!UPDATE: Exact day I am getting the vaccine is Wednesday, December 16.

"My grandpa tested positive for COVID. He was exposed last Wednesday (8 days ago). On Sunday, he was indoors for over an hour, no masks, with my parents and sister and her kids. They had a trip planned to Disney World this weekend (leaving Saturday). We live in Wisconsin. I tried to convince my sister and mom to reschedule and quarantine. I begged. I told them they could easily kill someone and be positive without having symptoms. They were still set on going. So I called Disney. The employee was just as shocked as I was. We spoke for a half hour, and in that time she went in and flagged them as exposed to COVID, so they wouldn’t be allowed into the resort or the parks without a negative test. She thanked me for calling and said she would pray they’d make the right decision."
"I had a headache for 3 days. It went away yesterday. I thought it was just because I was trying to cut back on sweet tea. Today, I started coughing. Kinda phlegmy. Now my chest hurts and feels heavy. No fever. Still have taste and smell.At what point should I see about getting tested? I'm not too worried about myself. I'm healthy, no underlying conditions. But I have an almost 3 year old and a 6 month old. I was reading that kids under 1 are at higher risk. My daughter is exclusively breastfed. I know breastfeeding helps immunity. I got strep throat when my son was a baby and he never caught it. Has breastfeeding been shown to help protect against covid?Also, I texted my husband at work today to let him know. He told his superiors and they scheduled him for a test tomorrow. He has no symptoms and his test won't be back for 2 days. I'm a stay at home. I never leave the house. I went to Walmart for some groceries the other day because I wanted to get out. Kids stayed home with my husband. I wiped the cart, wore a mask, used hand sanitizer, stayed away from everyone. My husband follows all the guidelines at work and when he goes to the store. This just sucks."
I’m ashamed that after one year of pandemic. We still struggled on the basic questions like whether to wear a mask. I’m soooooooooooooo tired.
"Got my first fever on Thanksgiving.  Last fever was yesterday morning.  I had every symptom, body aches, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cough, crazy sweating.  The fever spiked at 100.9 4 days ago.  I am 51 yo male in reasonable good shape.  I did get my Shingles AND Flu shot 6 days before onset of symptoms so my Dr thinks that made the experience worse for me as my immune system was already working OT.  This was by far the sickest I have ever been in my life.  I was one of those who thought this all was overblown.  I stand corrected.  Wear masks, social distance and be smart about your daily activities.  This thing is real.  I am very glad I am feeling better now."
"now don't get me wrong, ive had all my shots and im completely on with vaccines, but its a rushed and new vaccine, coudlnt it have some very nasty side effects?"
Now I have a headache. I have had it all day where they were stuffing that thing way too far up my nose. So invasive. Does this headache go away? It's right above my brow. On the same side they put the PCR test up my nostril.
"Hey all, My boyfriend tested positive today, has been very ill for three days (no pre-existing conditions). He doesn't live with me, but I see him regularly, as we both follow guidelines and restrictions closely. I have started developing the same symptoms and am starting to feel really sick. I have a test/exam tomorrow, but I would just like to hear from some fellow 20-somethings with chronic illness about their experience with Covid-19 symptoms. I'm quarantined for 20+ days and have to stay in my room because of my roommates. Any tips to help prepare/cope or pass the time?"
"I have a friend who uses a vape and showed me how when they used the vape with their mask on, the smoke still came out from the pores in the mask (as well as the sides). If this is the case with vape smoke, how do we know that masks are truly blocking particles (maybe in cases of sneezing)? I don't mean to sound insensitive or dumb; I believe in hard science, but I am wondering what the effectiveness is if we can clearly see smoke escape from the pores in the fabric (assuming the particles of smoke are the same size as regular particles emitted when we breathe or sneeze)?"
"From [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess\_deaths.htm#data-tables](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm#data-tables) I retrieved the Weekly number of deaths (from all causes) since 2017.From these data, I averaged the monthly number of deaths for the 2017-2019 period, and compared with 2020. If we take the Jan to November period, there is a 18.03% increase of deaths, and if we take the April-November period, there is a 22.06% increase of deaths. This is 434,199 more deaths from January to November 2020 than from the average number of death of the same months over 2017 to 2019."
I was experiencing symptoms of Covid-19 a few weeks ago. I self quarantined for 14 Days. Each day I felt better. I have 0 symptoms now and been sober for 19 days I’m concerned about smoking weed again. Has Anyone whos Recovered from COVID get back to smoking ? There’s no research on it so I’m asking Reddit
"I've come to a realization that there is a good chance I have the virus. My girlfriend's coworker slept over at a house who, 3 days after, have had the whole family test positive. She and my girlfriend work in relatively close quarters (with masks) for extended periods of time, roughly 6 hours, and I saw her a short time ago.I have super bad anxiety and it's seriously flaring up at this news. I've looked many places to find an accurate account of a relatively mild case from someone in a simliar situation health-wise.I'm a healthy 18 year old, and as such, I am hoping that should I have it, it stays mild. It also doesn't help that suffocation of any sort is my absolute worst fear.For those of you who have had the virus and don't mind answering, what does a mild case feel like? How much shortness of breath should I expect, and how long should I expect symptoms? Also, are there any sort of common cold medicines which help alleviate symptoms?Thank you for reading and I wish you all the best."
"when covid started, i ended up losing my job (a really bad one cause they overworked and abused us but i put up with it cause i needed the money) and the quarantine wasnt as hard at the beginning cause we had the mentality that the situation would be over soon. but it didnt. after months of looking, i found a job and it was okay though with little time i found out they lied a lot but still, i put it with it cause i needed the money. i live with my mom, who is an old person and needs me to care for her cause shes quite sick and through this pandemic, it has gotten worse. i got fired from my job cause, as i said, they lied or let out a lot of things which makes it easier for them to hire, use people and then drop them. i was one of them. i have been looking for a job and sadly, it's not been easy. im trying my best and it feels like its not enough. my mom needs meds that the hospital cant give her and, since i dont have a job, i dont have insurance so i cant get my meds (for depression and anxiety) so i need those meds too but we cant afford them.so this is me, asking for your help. hoping you can. i know there are kind people here cause through the pandemic, a few of them have helped me a bit but i dont want to become a burden to them or make them feel like im abusing their kindness.please, if you can help me with any amount you can, i will be forever grateful. im asking now and hopefully, soon, i can be helping tomorrow. please, if you can help me, i'll be thankful and you'll be a part of my life forever.https://www.paypal.me/krrp"
"Hello everyone, I’m currently about to end my quarantine this week. I’ve had no symptoms anymore for the past 4 days. I contacted my job to let them know I’ll be able to come back after Friday but they said that I won’t be able to come back unless I test negative. Even after I sent them links straight from CDC saying it is NOT recommended to retest within 90 days because the test still might come back positive when the person is no longer contagious.What have been you guys’ experience with retesting? Does it often come back positive 10 days after the first test?"
"People who receive the coronavirus vaccine will still need to wear a mask and practice social distancing, experts say, because it’s not yet known whether the shots can prevent even vaccinated individuals from spreading the virus.Vaccines can potentially serve three different purposes: they can prevent an infection by blocking a virus from invading cells in the body; they can reduce the risk of serious illness if a person is infected; or they can reduce the amount of virus a person “sheds,” essentially curbing a person’s ability to transmit the virus to others.“The challenge is that not all vaccines can do all three,” said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and the Moderna vaccine is 94.5 percent effective at reducing infection, but neither of the trials were designed to focus on whether the shots could prevent infection altogether — or what effect they could have on transmission.TheCDC has saidthat until more is known about how the vaccines perform under real-life conditions, “it will be important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic.”That includes wearing a mask, washing hands frequently and staying six feet apart from others.“A vaccine is a very important tool in our arsenal, but we also can’t overestimate it,” Lee said. “We have to layer all these interventions on top of each other to make them more effective.”"
"So sorry if this is the wrong place to post, but  i notified work, next of kin, people i contacted,  my primary care provider ( who hadn't gotten back to me yet). My symptoms include body aches, chills, a little bit of dizziness, all of which can be readily handled by tylenol, started yesterday im a 25 yr old male grom California with out any underlying conditions, i just now started getting some very light but very persistent chest pain, i can still take full breaths, Question is, at wich point do i go to the hospital"
"She works in an elderly home. So the party will be at the home with just the residents and the staff. Which makes her complaining worse. Do you want to kill all the residents at your workplace? She was telling me about the outfit and earrings she got for the party. And? There will be other Christmas Parties. Even before the pandemic she just acts like a child all the fucking time and it gets on my nerves. The worse thing is she doesn't understand what's childish or toxic about her behaviour. I am almost 21 and she is 44.Last week she was the one with a positive test. She has an expensive monthly travel card to get to work. I didn't know how to help her get a refund on it. The travelcard she had was different to my one. Her's went from Inside  London to outside London. Mine was from a London area to another London area. She was yelling at me to help her, saying that I did it for my own card so to help her with her's. ""I called them up explained the situation and they gave me the refund. So you need to call them."" ""Call them for me!"" Another childish thing she does. Our broadband is in her name and when there is an issue she refuses to call them. I have called about issues pretending to be my mum many times. ""No. Stop being a child. You are a grown arse adult you can do it yourself."" ""But I don't know how!"" She eventually ended up calling them. They told her to do it online. She couldn't figure out how to do it. So went back to me demanding for help I couldn't give. I suggested calling them again and asking them to guide her through the process (I think that is what she eventually did but she refused to at the time). ""If you don't help me I'm going to go to the rail station and ask them for help."" Remember she has tested positive for Covid. I decided to try reverse psychology. ""Okay. Fine. Just wear your mask."" ""No."" If you imagined a toddler refusing to do as a parent says. You would be correct. That is exactly how she said that. ""If you don't wear your mask you will get people killed."" ""No I won't!"" Bare in mind I am summarising this alot because most of the convocation was us just going in circles. Also bare in mind that this happened in the living room. And from the living room you can very clearly see most of the hall and the front door. Which has glass panels. So if she left I would see. I started threating to call 119 if she left the house without a mask. Which is the UK's Cornavirus helpline. If u did call and tell them about my mum she would get a massive fine. Like a child she tried denying the fact that she would be fined. Again circles. She then went into the hall. Opened the door and slammed it shut. I could see she was still in the hall. ""I can see you."" ""No you can't."" Seriously? She does this several times. And I am watching her in case she does actually leave so I can see her opening the door slamming it and rushing back to the ""blind spot"" where I can't see her. When I told her that I could see her opening and closing the door she opened the door again and actually left. But I could see she was just standing on the doorstep. I'm telling her that I can see her and that if she leaves I will call 119. At this point my ""dad"" (who believe it or not is alot worse just without the childishness) comes to the top of the stairs sees the empty hallway and thinks I'm talking to myself. ""You know she's left right?"" ""No she hasn't I can see her on the doorstep."" Coming in and trying the same 'trick' a few more times she eventually goes to her room to sort out her bloody travel card on her own. So yeah. That's my mother. How crazy/childish/toxic would you say she is? Cause at this point I'm just fucking sick and tired of this fucking house."
"We’ve been quarantining since last Monday. We got husbands positive results last Tuesday. I tested positive Thursday. Husband keeps saying things like “if I feel better I’ll go back to work and help out”“I don’t feel bad today, so I may go to the gym” He doesnt understand why I’m so irritated by this. As long as he feels “fine” it’s okay, right?"
"So......  my wife and I need help.  Please.Tonight during dinner, my daughter asked us both the following question:   “Could we get infected from COVID via farts?”   After a moment of silence, we started laughing and changed the topic.Buuuuuut!!!.....   Could we?   🙏😁,"
"Hi All, Last weekend I started feeling like I was getting a cold (sore throat, stuffy nose), then Sunday night I noticed that I completely lost my sense of taste and smell. I decided to get tested on Wednesday and took 3 covid test, one PCR at 10 AM, then went to Urgent Care and took 2 test, one rapid which came back negative, and the PCR which hasn't come back yet.My sense of taste and smell came back on Wednesday so I assumed I was fine, but then today I found out the 10 AM PCR test came back positive. Is it possible that I had the virus at 10 AM then didnt have it anymore at 7 PM when I took the other 2 tests. Taste and smell came back, sore throat is gone, but now possibly having shortness of breath and chest pain. How concerned should I be that this may be getting worse??Thanks all!"
"Why is it that I've been in high risk COVID environments and haven't contracted the virus? I've ate from the same table, shared the same cup and spoke to the same people who had positive PCR's but I just keep coming up negative. It's not like I want it, but I need to figure it out. My blood type is O- and I read that there was a study going on in the beginning of the year to see if there was a correlation but they debunked it. I work in a hospital, and still I haven't got it. Am I a freakin superhero???"
"My dad has started coughing a lot, I mean a lot. It hit me that he might have covid and I got worried. He is super arrogant and tries his best to not follow the rules on keeping safe; he tries to not wear his make as much (he fakes that he forgot to use his mask, etc.) And doesn't wash his hands etc etc. He gets super offended when we tell him to follow the rules and got angry when we told him that we were concerned he was infected. Mind you, our family has young kids and I don't want them to get hurt (brother 5, sister 11, me 17). We do have my mom btw.What can we do to protect ourselves if my dad doesn't want to protect us?"
"I was told if I wanted to take a test, I would have to wait at least 3-7 days after contact to take it because the test may come out negative. But does this mean it just won’t pick up I have covid, or does the virus not infect the body after 3-7 days? With or without symptoms, i’m trying to figure out if it just doesn’t show or it doesn’t infect. If so how long does it take for the virus to latch on and infect someone after contact?"
Will you get the vaccine as soon as you can or wait?[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/kg61qs)
"My family usually hosts a gathering of 12 folks (from 5 households) every year at Christmas in my grandfather's basement.  It's an event everyone looks forward to every year and has been a tradition in our tight knit family for more than 30 years.  We have one person flying in from Southern California and another from London, and the rest of us are scattered throughout the tristate area.  Obviously this year is different because of Covid, and with my late 50s father recently finding out that he needs a heart transplant within the next 2 years, and my late 80s grandfather in ailing health with Parkinson's, I expected that it would be cancelled or reimagined in some way. The event is still going on.  From what I understand, all are expected to still attend.  I had planned to go, with the assumption that we would all quarantine for 14 days prior, and for those who can't, we'd get Covid tests 2-3 days prior and only attend if they came out negative.  I planned to get tested 72 hours before Xmas and have been working from home and quarantining for the past week.Over the past week, I've been asking my parents and sisters what everyone's situation is and what their plans are for getting a covid test.  Neither of my parents plan to be tested, and feel because they don't ""leave the state"" they are safe.   They have heard nothing from the host on that topic, and they also did not plan to ask what the status was with the other family members which I found bizarre (and dangerous) given my dad's health. I thought it would be OK to send a mass text to the group going to ask what people's plans were.   Something like: ""Hi everyone! Excited to see you all. Just checking in on regards to the covid situation - are people quarantining, planning to be tested? Just thinking about those who are vulnerable and want to know they will be safe. Thank you"".Quickly after sending it - I had mixed emotions.  I felt guilty, but then realized the host should have already asked this question, my dad and grandpa are in vulnerable health - and probably, I shouldn't be going at all. I surmised that logically, based on Covid numbers skyrocketing everywhere,  it's a dumb idea to be gathering with this many at risk folks in a basement without much ventilation.  I'm embarrassed to say it took me having to send that text to realize it. When only 3 of the 11-12 people responded about testing, I got a pretty good sense that it wasn't top of mind for most people. The person who is flying from London, confirmed she was testing before and after her flight and takes Covid seriously but otherwise it was crickets, and the subject was changed immediately after I sent it.  The person coming from California sent a photo of a drink she planned to bring, and as a sidenote said she was getting tested but doesn't know if the results will be back in time for Christmas.  Others responded to that text by saying ""that looks good!"" And ""yum"". No one else answered my question after that.My dad told me that his Christmas will be worse if I don't come and to just trust that everyone has been safe.  He has never really grasped the seriousness of Covid and says that it's not ""normal"" to be apart from family for this long.  I obviously know going to this gathering would be irresponsible but I want my dad to have a nice Christmas because I'm not sure how many he has left.  I'm now fearing for his life.  I know my family thinks I'm crazy and dramatic.  As of now, I stated to my immediate family (7 people, and the bulk of the party) that I don't plan to go, but no one else except one of my other sisters verbally agreed with me.  There has been a lot of silence and it's been really demoralizing. I feel like I'm in the twilight zone and have a sense that this is going to be the last interaction I'm going to have with several of my family members... due to their selfishness and irresponsibility.  I am not one to stand on a moral pedestal so all of this is very uncomfortable for me.  I don't even know how to feel OK about being the sole person refusing to go - I hold a lot of guilt about these type of things, though I've given it thought and my stance is firm.    Comments / advice / thoughts welcome. TL; DR- Large family gathering is still going on with several people in ill health that I think should be cancelled but my comments are being ignored.  Need advice."
"I AM COVID POSITIVE.If you haven't been affected by this epidemic directly yet, now you know somebody. Please continue reading..So far I have had mild symptoms just like a cold or flu. I started feeling the onset of maybe getting sick on Sunday, knew it was something by Monday, and lost my sense of taste and smell Tuesday. I finally got a COVID testing time slot yesterday, was lucky enough to receive a rapid test, and received a phone call with the results last night. I almost didn't want to get tested because I was already feeling better by then. But as a precaution I went and got the test anyway. I have been practicing every preventative precaution since the very beginning. I have remained unemployed since the original shutdown and limited any travel and contact to family and groceries. I also played everything extra safe because I made the personal choice that I wanted to be available as a safety net stepmom in case of any covid related situation where child care from a healthy adult was needed with both parents still required to be working and the daycare system wasn't worth the exposure risk. But all it takes is one person in your cautious selective circle to not tell anyone that they are sick and encounter you like it's nothing. And all your efforts are gone just like that. When I first received the results I informed everyone I had been in contact with. Since I was the one reporting the official positive test result I immediately felt stigmatized even by my loved ones, even though it was in my own head, not intentionally directly by them. It wasn't my fault. There is no way to know for sure, so no point in pointing blame on the source. Yet initially I felt like I was being looked at as the source, the blame, the bad guy. But I was the one who did the right thing and proactively got tested and respectfully informed everyone, and it didn't take me long to remind myself that there is no shame or stigma in doing what is right. An epidemic means a huge number of people are affected so we are not alone or less than, we are just now a part of the directly affected side of it. We are all globally a part of it. At first because of my stigma complex I had no intention of publicly sharing my results on social media. However, then I decided that I wanted to share, say my piece, and maybe have some sort of positive affect on anyone or everyone. We are all a part of this and all have different views primarily determined by the extent to which it directly affects us and the views of others around us. All I know is there should be no stigma for having covid and if you find yourself positive don't let yourself feel that way and don't be reluctant to do the right thing. It's true precautions only get you so far, but it's better than nothing. The thing is everyone needs to remember to simply let one another know when you think you may be getting sick before encountering them in person that way they have ability to personally choose whether or not to be around you in person. I've seen numerous examples now that this simple issue of respect to those in your inner circle has been a huge piece of the increasing spread...people simply choosing not to mention they might be sick. Regardless of whether the decision is because you think it's nothing, no big deal, or don't want to jepordize the time with that person, just consider how selfish it is to withhold the opportunity to make their own educated decisions from someone you care about. No, this does not eliminate encounters when somebody feels fine before they feel symptoms of any kind of unwellness but may already be contagious. But that's the fine threshold between things you can and can't control. This failure to make thoughtful decisions is what brought such an increase after Thanksgiving and many of you will be faced with these decisions for Christmas. They say people with mild to moderate symptoms remain contagious no more than 10 days after the onset of symptoms. I am right on the cusp of that cut off for Christmas time and based on how I'm feeling will have to make the decision with family on whether it will be a Quarantine Christmas, but I will likely try to get in for another test right before. I've been lucky so far and only have mild flu like symptoms if that. The body aches is all I have right now. So yeah, it may not be a huge deal, but the huge deal many are disregarding is that everyone is affected in different levels of severity. So before you go around for Christmas with just a little cold not telling anyone, ask yourself if it's worth the gamble of possibly putting a loved one in the hospital. Honestly, it should have been previously more normalized to share informative caution with others in consideration of any potential contagious sickness regardless of how common a cold may be. But instead many treat it with insignificant disregard. Hopefully covid brings a new societal norm that will increase our overall respect and well being. That is all. Stay safe everyone."

"Asking for a friend I haven’t seen in months. She has symptoms (bronchitis like, headache, behind eye pain, fever etc) she took both a pcr and a rapid upon the first day of symptoms both came back negative. She’s now on day 4 and still sick. I’m worried for her because she’s talking about returning back to work. Any one have this experience and then later test positive ?"
"How would this work out? Should be everyone, right?"
"I (18f) live with my parents and attend online school. I also work part time and always wear a mask. However, at my work this weekend, I was around quite a few people, some of which didn’t wear masks. I was wearing a mask the whole time but am still cautious. My mom wants to have my grandma (who is 86 with health problems) over for Christmas but no one will be wearing a mask, and I told her I was concerned about possibly giving my grandma COVID, as I could have it and be asymptomatic. My parents then got mad at me for suggesting she spend Christmas alone, which is the only alternative to her coming over. What do I do?"
If you look at [the chart for Turkey](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/turkey/) November 10th-25th it was fairly flat then went vertical then leveled off *very* abruptly. It doesn't look natural. What happened?
"I tested positive on 12/18 and my symptoms started with a sore throat and head congestion, which is fairly common from what I've read. Now my nose is burning? Like inside my nose and into my sinuses feels like I inhaled cayenne pepper. Has anyone else experienced this? Any way to make it stop? Also, has anyone figured out how to get their taste and smell back? Having two kids in diapers and not being able to smell is difficult."
"So I started having symptoms (fever, headache, sore throat, etc) on dec. 7th. I took a test a few days after and tested positive. I have been quarantined in my own room until today I took another test and I came out negative. &amp;#x200B;Since I have only been in my room for these two weeks, is It possible that I could get covid again simply by being in my room?"
"My co worker recently had taken a test, and she tested negative. She lives with her positive-tested husband as of now. She will continue to go back to work as usual. I however do not work with her until next week. In the meanwhile she will work with the same co workers I work with interchangeably this week. My boss and co workers know, but will continue  to work because they need to keep paying their bills.How do I go about this? Do I confront my boss and notify him that I am available to work, and that her being in the workplace will endanger us and can cause problems for him in the future.(not trying to say I will sue.)  And continue to work like the rest of my co workers? Also, we might shut down in a month or so, due to financial issues."

"So I received the first dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine yesterday, about 24 hours from now. I wanted to share this with other people who are skeptical or have questions about whether or not to get the vaccine. First, myself and several of my friends who also received it did not have any major symptoms. The only ones we all had were slight fatigue and a very very minor headache. For me, a little sleep and some coffee fixed that haha. Our arms were slightly sore after receiving the vaccine, as with any vaccine (flu, hep B, etc.). However, the soreness has diminished and is nearly gone. Some of my friends reported that during the vaccination, it burned a little (I did not experience this). These are really the only symptoms that me and many others I know experienced. HOW IT WORKS: Its a two step process, so I will have to receive a second dose in a few weeks. The vaccine does not actually contain COVID. It does however contain mRNA to help develop antibodies for the spike protein that encases and harnesses covid-19. Covid-19 is actually a very fragile virus, but it’s the spike proteins of the virus that bind to our cells that make it so easy to catch. So, by having antibodies for the spike proteins, hopefully the body will be able to mount a defense against the virus early and protect against it. HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?:There isn’t any official word yet as to how long the vaccine will protect against COVID-19. Ive done some reading into it, and so far, there is one study that says that the Moderna vaccine antibodies drop off by about 90% in some cases after six months from the second vaccine. It is important to note, however, that this is different per person. Some people retain their antibodies longer than others, and still had more present at the six month period. I am unsure as to the Pfizer vaccine length of protection. We might have to receive the vaccine 2-3 times per year to continue protection, or they could alter the vaccine soon to maybe make its protection last a little longer... it’s still too early to tell.WHAT ABOUT LONG-TERM EFFECTS?: Obviously it is too early to measure any kind of long-term effects of the vaccine. I will say that when asking yourself this question, you should also take into consideration the long-term effects of catching COVID-19. Many people are developing long-term and chronic health conditions as a result of COVID-19. My friend has developed several new health problems. She has permanent heart damage, kidney damage, and they are talking about potentially placing a pacemaker due to her complications from it. She developed cytokine storm. And my friend was healthy. She didn’t have any major underlying problems before, and is barely 40 years old. There IS a high survival rate for catching Covid-19.... but there aren’t any real studies on how many people that survived developing long-term chronic conditions as a result of the virus. So I encourage everyone to take this into account when weighing the risks/benefits of the vaccine. Thank you for taking the time to read my experience, I apologize for the length. Please feel free to reach out to me or send me a message if anyone has any questions or concerns. I am no expert, but I have done a fair amount of research into this, as I myself was skeptical of receiving the vaccine. Hope everyone has a wonderful holiday!!! :)"
I was exposed on 12-12 (from my dad who was tested positive on 12-15) and I got my positive result on 12-22. The only symptoms I've had are a stuffy nose and a headache. But I have had a stuffy nose and constant headaches for most of life at almost all times. When do I know I am through with this thing since I dont actually have the no symptoms for 24 hours gauge and everything I read says ill be positive when tested for the next 3 months
I had Covid-19 last week and i am now recovering just fine. My only lingering symptoms seem to be some nasal congestion and no taste or smell at all? It’s been a little less than a week of no taste or smell. Is there a timeline on how long until they come back?
"Dad started feeling bad Monday. Fever of 101, vomiting and diarrhea, no breathing issues. Thought it was a stomach bug. He felt better Tuesday, but Wednesday was delirious, so mom took him to the hospital. He coded right after he got there, they weren’t able to bring him back. He tested positive for COVID. It only took three days. They have been safe, staying in, only going out for groceries, always wearing masks. Mom has tested negative, but is quarantining regardless. Stay safe."
"by 'minor' covid i mean your symptoms are very minor compared to the extremes (for example, i have covid but it feels exactly like a cold. just a runny/stuffy nose basically and that i get fatigued a little easier than usual.) my symptoms started with a light fever and chills but since last week, those symptoms have been gone. i've been sick since december 12 and was shocked when i got tested this past sunday and saw that i was still positive for covid (and a little bummed). tl;dr: i'm just wondering when i might possibly fully recover from covid since my case is very minor and i don't have any severe symptoms at all, i've had covid for the last two weeks."
34F Do you think 2021 will be better than this year? Do you think things will get better?Is it too soon to tell? Do you think the vaccine will be the talk of 2021? It is now. That and the election. What do you think/predict will happen next year? Do you think 2020 is just the beginning for some major changes to come?Is the world as we know it never going to be the same or is this another pandemic that'll take a couple years to fully blow out?
"Everyone wants to talk about the mental stress on the hospital teams, yet I know a ton of people in the medical industry that have been out &amp; about over the holidays mask-less. Everyone wants to talk about the economy, yet no one talks about enforcement of masks by fines. I am not living in fear and I am also not anti-mask. My motto is ""do what's easier for the other person if it has no affect on you"".  Aka... Wear a fucking mask if you aren't scared of COVID. The other person is doing both:  being scared and wearing a mask.  #considerthyneighborsphobiaAmericans lack this ^^^ compassion so we will not kick this for a LONG while. I am particularly focused on the airlines letting everyone travel. I am concerned with people being let into other countries with a negative test upon arrival when we still do not fully understand how exposure works. Why is this okay? Why are hotels allowed to sell rooms so cheap to stay alive yet I'm stuck cooking &amp; serving myself every damn night!? I would personally LOVE to know:- if Jan gets COVID on a Monday, tests negative three times in 10 days, tests positive on her fourth test on day 11, can she pass along her exposure to others within day one-10?- if Earl gets COVID in November, has it for 21 days, rests &amp; quarantines, tests negative on day 22, can he still expose a non-COVID person on day 23?I am concerned for long-term, lingering side effects of both COVID-19 and the vaccine. Why? Because the people I know who've survived COVID or died from COVID have all been greatly affected in different ways. So to me, it's not about it having a high survival rate. It's not about being scared OR being unphased. It's not about a negative test a day after exposure!It's about if we legit want this to go away, we have to become aggressive with those refusing to look outside of the above statements. Do you question your immediate circle's selfish decisions? Or just shake your head at them over coffee with your other friend? Stand-up to them-- you're part of the problem if you aren't."
"My fiance took the covid vaccine.  Within two day she lost the use of her legs.  She has never had any major issues with walking, or mobility. doctors say she has nerve damage, however, they will not say it has anything to do with the vaccine.  They also didn't tell her she had nerve damage, before discharging her saying she just need to go to rehabilitation.  The diagnosis is that its Guillain-Barré but we only found out by going back and checking the notes from the mychart app.  I cant say 100% the vaccine caused this because im no doctor, but she was fine before she got the shot.  I will not stop until i figure out why this happened if you know anyone or find anything with cases like this after the vaccine let me and everyone know."

"I had Covid for the first 2 weeks of October. Now , I am suddenly finding that so many foods taste and smell horrid. I cannot eat eggs, they taste and smell so rotten, literally like human sh*t. Wine kinda tastes like vinegar, and my favorite food, steak, tastes rotten no matter how fresh it is. I looked it up and many others have had the problem... if you have, did it go away? Or am I stuck like this indefinitely? It was out of nowhere and started a week or two ago."
"Vaccine Facts (Pfizer):1. It’s mRNA, not a small dose of COVID - The vaccine is basically sending a messenger to tell your body to produce proteins that will destroy COVID-19 as the virus tries to enter your body.2. mRNA is located outside the nucleus of your cells (in the cytoplasm where it will be translated into protein), so no, it will not alter your DNA or 🧬 code.3. It was tested on 44,000+ participants in a double blinded placebo study. Half of the patients received the vaccine, other half received the placebo. 4. ~95% efficacy rate. Effective rate we’ll find in due time. The ~95% efficacy rate came from the results of the phase 3 trial in which 162 placebo recipients got infected with COVID-19 vs. the 8 vaccine recipients who got infected (out of 22,000+ participants from each group). If interested, DM me for the math to how pfizer got to ~95% efficacy with those numbers.5. The vaccine is named BNT162b2 and will be given in 2💉💉 doses 21 days apart. Make sure to take the 2nd dose to achieve &amp; maintain the ~95% efficacy rate. The first dose will prime your body to create the spike proteins needed to destroy the anatomy of the corona virus 🦠. The second dose will build the army of spike proteins to keep you protected. The length of time the 2 doses will protect against COVID-19 is to be determined. The participants from March 2020 are still protected at the ~95% efficacy rate, so it is promising.Reasons why you don’t want the vaccine:1. Speed of approval - this has been the fastest vaccine ever produced in the history of mankind. Ans: This is the 1st mRNA vaccine to be produced by intelligent scientists, doctors, and highly advanced technology. Speed doesn’t mean less efficient, we should realize how much science has advanced.2. Long term effects - It is too soon to know the long term effects of this vaccine.Ans: mRNA is fragile and will disintegrate in your body if you don’t keep it going. Every drug we take has side effects. Pfizer also makes viagra, a side effect being an inability to differentiate between the colors green and blue😯.3. Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) - will the vaccine give me GBS?Ans: There is no evidence to link GBS to the mRNA vaccine. The ratio of people who received the vaccine and have GBS is consistent with the yearly ratio of GBS incidence in the United States.4. Government- Can’t trust them.Ans: True. Especially for people of color, I totally understand. But we also have to focus on how many intellectuals🧠 and advancements in tech it took to bring forth this vaccine. I feel more comfortable when I think about the intellectuals. This vaccine would not be here if it wasn’t for them. Government=Politics and its understandable if they are not to be trusted. But intellectuals=science and it is amazing that we even have this vaccine available, Dr. Fauci approved😁.5. 44,000 participants - is this enough to push the vaccine to the public?Ans: Hats off to these brave people 🎩. Especially since they were double blinded with either the vaccine or placebo. There are a lot more people now who have taken the vaccine. Few have gotten anaphylactic shock, most had a sore arm. If side effects worry you, stop taking other drugs you take either by recreation or prescription🤷🏻‍♂️. Who shouldn’t take the vaccine:1. If you’re under 16 yrs of age2. If you have any allergies to the Pfizer vaccine components (see link below)https://www.fda.gov/media/144413/download Take with caution if:1. You’re pregnant or planning to be pregnant2. Have allergies to other vaccines3. Take immunosuppressants or you are immunocompromised.Of course speak with your doctor if you have concerning underlying medical conditions.Don’t take the vaccine if you currently have COVID. If you had COVID or you are over the quarantine period, then yes - take the vaccine. Your antibodies will help you for only ~90days if you recovered from the virus, according to present studies. Why you should take the vaccine:Benefits outweigh risks. Simple as that.We are all probably desensitized by now but the deaths and infection rate is staggering (This is probably the only fact that has been consistent through our battle with this virus, consider all the changes with your hospital/CDC/media etc.)Take a look: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.htmlPatients are on multiple forms of life support, bleeding out from every orifice of their body, unable to breathe, unable to move due to fever and body aches. If you didn’t have someone you really loved in the hospital, you don’t know what it’s like. No visitors, maximum isolation, loneliness and delay of care is expected as we are all trying to protect ourselves from this microscopic organism. Woohoo for you if you were asymptomatic with COVID, you don’t know what long term effects it will have on you either.With all said,Do humanity a favor, take the vaccine.Ps. Of course you can make you’re own decision, this is 🇺🇸:)Also check out my website🙏🏽: https://www.giftourheroes.comInstagram: @GiftOurHeroes"
I started feeling symptoms Christmas Day. My throat is sore and I’m coughing but that’s all the symptoms I have. I think it’s just strep or a regular sore throat but my anxiety tells me otherwise.Update: I’m getting tested.
"my fiance is having his teen visit for xmas for a week. all i want is for everyone to wear a mask if we cant social distance. but everytime i say something im just a nag. im so sick of it. what should i do?UPDATE:thanks for all your recommendations, suggestions,  and stories everyone! its not perfect but its much better now. i pretty much threatened to go on strike if everyone doesn't wear their masks. i can tell they're at least TRYING to make me happy.i guess i also needed the validation that i wasn't being a pain in the A... it IS a real concern and i have a right to be worried. I'm a CMA and wanna go back to school for nursing so I'll have to deal with plenty of people like my own family in the future. stay safe everyone and happy new year!"
Not sure if this has been posted before. Interesting discovery for lung treatment for covid patients.[Skip to 6 min](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aYmoLjuf8Y)
Im trying to understand herd immunity. I know fauci says somewhere between 70-80% need to be vaccinated. Lets say 25% are vaccinated will we begin to see a sharp decline in new infections?
"TL;DR: both my parents have COVID due to a coworker not masking. Can I report the company they work for to CDC as a ""breeding ground"" they should go check up on? TIASoo... Both my parents have COVID. My mom is a nurse; I know she was careful -- especially as my dad is in his 60s and diabetic. So I asked if they had any idea how they may have caught it as Dad is hospitalized. Some fool co-worker of Dad's refused to mask up, caught COVID and passed it around. A friend's spouse's coworkers also were anti-maskers and their workplace received a special visit from the CDC. Now I'm wondering how that visit happened and if a civilian can complain to make such a visit occur and how they should go about it?Thank you in advance."
"Hello I recently tested positive and although all my symptoms are gone I smelled all sorts of strange things, while I had Covid I could smell the sickness in us. Today I went to go get tested and but where we go there’s only 150 test and on a first come first served basis and I walked there and got there at 7 am a long line was there even tho they don’t start to give them out at around 9ish but I could smell it again. The closer I got the more the smell was prominent, can anyone else do this? Also while going to the clinic I passed by the fire station and I could smell the disinfectant like it reeked of disinfectant so I know my nose isn’t off , can anyone else smell the smell? TLDR: I got Covid and while sick I could smell the sickness and I think I can smell it on others , does anyone else know the smell ?"
My coworker is asymptomatic but discovered yesterday that he had covid. We are very close coworkers and friends so yes we have been in frequent contact and near each other repeatedly. My test isn’t scheduled until another two days but is it safe to assume I have it ? I’ve been quarantining but I’m anxiously trying to prepare for the worst. I don’t know what to expect. Thanks guys!
The desperation. The shock. The sadness.  This thing quickly spread across the country with a low comnicability. Now the super strain is here. Save a nurse. Save your family. Save your neighbor. Save yourself. Mask up people! Stay home! Please!!!
"I received my first dose of the Moderna vaccine yesterday at 3pm.  It was as easy or easier than the flu shot... barely felt it.By midnight (9 hours later) my arm started hurting.  It has ached all day today, I would say slightly worse than the flu shot. Definitely noticeable.  The other thing is that I haven’t been able to get warm since this morning, so I just took my temp.  I usually run at about 97 deg and right now I’m 99.2 deg.  So slightly elevated temp and chills.  I’m bundled up now as I write this, 24 hours post-vaccine (first shot).For comparison, I had COVID in November.  I had fatigue, headache, chills, temp of 100.4, loss of appetite and no taste/smell for a week.  Undoubtedly a mild case, but for someone that doesn’t get sick often it was certainly noticeable (especially the fatigue and fever) and not something I’d like to repeat.  My sister had it at the same time and is still coughing incessantly, without relief.  We’re worried about her lungs.I expect to go to sleep tonight early and wake up just fine tomorrow, my immune system working it out. They said the day after could result in some of these symptoms and here they are, but it’s not like I was going to a NYE rager anyway.  Fingers crossed for next year. I’ll update tomorrow if anything changes.  Happy New Year, and get vaccinated!!!EDIT:  48 hours out update - Last night I had a temp that reached up to 99.9 F, and my arm was pretty painful and red and warm where I got the shot.  It’s now 2:40pm, I got the shot 48 hours ago, and I’m totally fine. If I raise my arm I can feel it, but it’s like 1% of the discomfort I was feeling even early this morning.  All other symptoms are gone!"
"Posting to be helpful to anyone trying to decide if perhaps they may have covid. I'm 38 F with 4 teenagers and 39 M partner living in the house. Im a waitress in a high end restaurant and considered very healthy. I've taken my temp constantly and never had a temp above 98.9.Current Situation - It's 12:44 am on Jan 1. I just woke up after sleeping most of the night and realized I've been fighting this for a week already. Symptoms aren't necessarily worse, just different.Thursday Dec. 24 - developed a headache in the evening while on a  zoom call with family, poured a little wine for myself and realized I didn't feel the greatest maybe from the wine or my period, but brush it off because it's not unusual for me. Friday Dec 25 - Headache. All day. I take my usual dose of advil. Headache never goes away completely. We cook prime rib and after dinner my stomach is upset. I decide I've had too much rich food and take some tums. At some point I took Excedrin. I remember thinking that maybe it was what caused my upset belly as well. Headache never clears fully.Saturday Dec 26 - I'm going on a sleigh ride socially distanced outside with our kids and my fiance's family for their Christmas gathering. I'm nervous about going because I still have a headache and just feel off. His mom has been fully quaratined since March because she is super high risk. I'm supposed to be at the restaurant later in the day.I tell my fiance I'm unsure if I'm just having a normal migraine or if I should be hunkering down. He tells me it's whatever I think, but since I don't have a fever not to worry about it. I decide that without evidence I need to meet my obligations to work and family. (Clearly I should have listened to my gut on this one, but at the time didn't want to overreact and worry people especially since I didn't know anyone with covid).Sunday Dec 27 - still have the damn headache and feel off.Monday Dec 28 - mother effing headache still... (migraine in my mind at the time) I keep popping advil and switched to Tylenol at some point, which I never take. I'm desperate for this headache to clear. I spend the day focused on some real estate work I'm doing. Monday night 8pmish I feel my upper back tighten. I cough a tiny little dry cough. I decide I can't go back into the restaurant without knowing for sure if I have covid. It's been days of feeling off and now I'm convinced something isn't right. I get a telehealth screening and they qualify me for a rapid test for Wednesday morning as well as the PCR test.Tuesday  Dec. 29 -  coughing more, but nothing substantial, headache, and a little less energy. Now I'm thinking this really might be covid, so I hunker down.Wednesday Dec 30 - 10 am I get my rapid test covid positive result. Call my boss at the restaurant who confirms I'm not the only one and that we'll be shut down for a minimum 10 days. I still have a headache and feel like all the moisture has been sucked out of the air. Cough is just a shallow dry cough. Nothing worrying. Thursday Dec 31 - Cough has really developed. When I cough it goes on and on. I've quarantined myself in my room. No one else in the house has symptoms yet. I'm super bummed because my kids are all stuck here. We obviously don't want to spread it to the other 2 households that our kids go to.Current symptoms - constant tickle in my throat, headache, cough, and now a runny nose. On Sunday I was reading through reddit trying to find evidence that I may have covid and never spike a fever. So, if you have a headache and feel a bit off you're not overreacting.  Hunker down and get yourself tested. ✌"
"HiI’ve been totally isolated for the last 6 weeks. Not seeing a single soul, having my groceries dropped at my door downstairs (no contact), washing and sterilizing all food and packages (I’ll even leave non-perishables or mail packages aside for days before touching / opening), not ordering any take out and constantly keeping hands clean and my house sterilized (I’m a germaphobe!)How in the hell do I have a sore throat right now?! What else could be causing it when I’ve not have contact with the outside world?H"
There are surprisingly only two apps I found that can do this. Here they are if you keep forgetting your mask!Here is an app for iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wearyourmask/id1545852465](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wearyourmask/id1545852465)Here is one for android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hudzah.wearamask&amp;hl=en\_US&amp;gl=US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hudzah.wearamask&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US)
"I started having symptoms that I brushed off on Saturday 12/19 - lingering headache, fatigue, and waking up drenched in sweat. I got tested the following Wednesday 12/23 when someone notified me of their test being positive. Throughout the week the headache continued to linger and I continued sweating. My test (rapid PCR) on Wednesday 12/23 was negative, but I tested positive for Influenza B. I woke up on Thursday 12/24 with a throbbing headache and chills. The symptoms continued and I developed a cough on Saturday 12/26. The worst part is I would either start the day feeling well and end up feeling terrible by the end of the day or visa versa. It came in waves. I got tested again on Monday 12/28 and it was negative. On Tuesday 12/29 I began to lose my taste and by nightfall I ran my first low-grade fever (99.8*). The symptoms were mild (thankfully). For the most part I was only experiencing sxs of fatigue, headache, low-grade fevers, chills, night sweats, some mild nausea, and a cough. Moral of this post is, if you show symptoms - please take care of yourself regardless of test results. I am finally feeling better the last 2 days. I know this was not just the flu, because I have had the flu before. If anyone has had a similar experience I would love to hear about it. This is my first post on reddit so I apologize if anything isn't correctly done or whatever. I mostly use this sight for informational reading."
"I’ve been experiencing covid-like symptoms since yesterday. While I’m not all too worried about having it or just a cold/flu (I don’t really get sick too often, the chest congestion is the symptom that concerns me most) I’m worried about passing it to my 74 year old grandmother who is high-risk (diabetes and heart problems) She insists I need to get tested, and while I agree... I do not drive. She or my uncle (who we also live with) would have to drive me to a testing site, in hopes I’ll even get one since I’m not severe (no fever, no cough) and I currently have no insurance. Is it worth putting my family members and others at risk to find out if I do in fact have covid? Do I need to find out anyway since I’ve been in contact with people over the past couple weeks? Or should I just keep to myself in my room and disinfect behind me as I need to enter the main part of the house? Im not really sure what to do. I also have a job, I called out today and I’m off tomorrow. I’m hoping to be feeling better by Monday. I just don’t know if I MUST get tested or if it’s safer for my grandmother if I just.. stay to myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thank you for your time."
"That’s it, that’s the post. I cannot believe how much silly misinformation there is out there with 330,000+ people dead.For example, NYT, WAPO, VOX, the Atlantic, Dr. Osterholm’s weekly Cidrap update/podcast, all have reliable information about Covid. Bodies are filling up morgues daily, like in some 19th century novel, we likely won’t even be out of this until next year at the earliest, and people are still treating this like a hoax or relying purely on social media for information. I don’t understand it."
"Okay so I possibly came into contact with someone who contracted COVID. It’s been about a week and I have no other symptoms but a runny noes which I blame the drastic weather changes in Texas for. So I got tested and my results came back positive for both the flu and COVID. I have UCTD, which is is autoimmune issue and When I get sick I get extremely sick, usually ends up with me in the ER, but how is it possible that I have both of these and have zero symptoms?? Could it be a false positive? The nurse that delivered my test results had his face and relaxed his arms in my car window, not even the least but concerned that I tested positive which I find pretty odd."
"Thank you to all first responders, essential workers, and researchers. Thank you more than anything. Please wear a mask. I take my last breathAs I enter the wardNaked facedNothing moreI put on armorShields of goldEmpty boxesNo one toldThe fear is realThe lies are trueWe’re here aloneIt’s me and youThe fight is comingIt’s not here yetI fret and fearBut soon forgetI see you breathe An iron lungI feel your pulseFeel high strungI watch you sleepWill you wake?I watch her cryWill she break?The lights go crazyThe world goes blackI see her cryWe’re under attackThe breath you breatheIs your lastWhat you’d planned Is now the pastI take my armor offI cry in silence I breatheMy last breath."
"While scientists are relatively certain neither is more deadly, higher transmissibility could spell big trouble.We looked at 24 articles from 21 sources to clarify just how potentially dangerous these new Covid variants are.

"My uncle has been in the hospital for 3 weeks due to this stupid virus, both his lungs have collapsed, all other organs are fine but doctors say it would only takes a miracle for him to survive. He has an artificial lung and he is on the respirator going from 40 to  90 % of oxygen.(it varies)The doctors called my aunt to give her the ultimatum, they are asking us what we want to do.Is the hospital just trying to get their room free, is there chance for a person who is in this situation for his lungs to recover, perhaps in a few more weeks?"
"Hey, I’ve been very frustrated talking with family members who believe the pandemic is fake. They think that either the government created it, the government is lying, and that scientists are all in this hoax. They think that the swab itself has some type of chip that is put in your brain to control you. As if we don’t just have our phones on us all day. How can they just deny that people are literally dying?? It seems very selfish to walk around without a mask just because you don’t believe in it (for whichever reason). I run covid samples to check if people have the virus or not, so do my family members just think I sit around all day deciding who is positive and who is negative?? How should I continue approaching this situation without feeling drained each day? Is it worth using facts with someone who straight up thinks science is fake? Is there a “spiritual” way to approach this? Any feedback would be appreciated. I want to reach some type of common ground."
"My dad has had Covid twice, and my mom has had it once. I live with them, but every single time I test negative. Is it possible to just, not get covid? I am a healthy teenager and I take vitamins, so perhaps my immune system is strong enough to not get covid? I don't want to say I'm immune, and I won't slack on precautions. Has this situation happened to anyone else?Edit: I'm getting my antibodies tested on Saturday"
"My wife and I just did the drive through saliva test in our city. The lady gave me a tube and told me to spit into it and she walked back to her building to grab another tube for my wife. We noticed that there was already a liquid in the tube up to the point she told me to spit to (the end of the label on the tube). We figured maybe she meant for me to fill the tube to the other end of the label and that the liquid had to do with some chemical that is used in the testing process... so I went ahead and spit into it. When she came back she gave my wife a test tube with nothing in it, at which point I got very worried and told the testing lady that there was something in mine. She said oh give that to me and I’ll get you another one. When she came back I asked her if that was a tube that had already been used. She replied with “oh no that’s just a solution that was still in there” and muttered something about “they forgot to empty it out of there” (couldn’t really hear her). I’m worried that the “solution” that was in there was actually someone else’s spit and the lady said “solution” to cover her own ass. Does anyone have any knowledge about how they administer the tests? I cant find anything online about it. It would be very relieving if they use solutions to disinfect or something along those lines and they simply didn’t dump it out beforehand."
"I’m a nurse.  I feel it’s important to address something that has came to light for me over the last few weeks. During the entire Covid “pandemic” I have witnessed a multitude of issues that have not settled well with me. This last hospital policy has really made me question the hospitals response to properly address current hospitalized patients. Currently, any patient that is exposed to a positive COVID roommate in a semi-private room gets put on COVID isolation for 14 days. They are on isolation for 14 days regardless of their test results. Yet, the staff that took care of the positive patient are not. We are expected to come to work and ‘monitor’ for symptoms. We are also expected to come to work regardless if someone in our household tests positive and again ‘monitor’ for symptoms. I don’t know about any of you, but doesn’t this strike you strange ? To me it’s the absolute ass backwards scenario of healthcare but we’re left with staffing challenges so it’s completely bypassed. You be the judge."
"I have in-laws who from the beginning of this crisis have shouted from the rooftops that covid is fake, trump is God, &amp; have vehemently refused to wear a mask &amp; have also spent the last year travelling far &amp; wide.

Have hosted &amp; attended any gathering possible ( covid is a democratic plot to undermine their supreme ruler) have  totally disregarded  social distancing ( we do as we damn well please, after all we are REPUBLICANS &amp; the rules dont apply to us!!!) &amp; today they both recieved their first vaccine dose ( they are late 70's)  I am FURIOUS!!!  I have followed any &amp; all CDC guidelines, since March I have only left my house to go to work, buy groceries  &amp; today to take my cat to the vet. I have taken every possible precaution to keep myself &amp; family safe. I have to wait for who knows how long until  my turn comes to recieve the vaccine. I know there are many many others like me who have followed the rules, worn masks, washed &amp; sanitized our hands raw, missed birthdays, Christmas &amp; all other celebrations out of a desire to keep ourselves &amp; loved ones safe. But by virtue of being elderly these covid denying, tRump loving, anti-mask douche canoes get the fucking vaccine for a virus they insist is fake???!!! I am beyond disgusted. There are limited doses of vaccine available, so it is being offered first to healthcare workers ( as it should) then nursing home residents ( as it should) but next in line these people? W.T.F? In what alternate reality is this acceptable? What about the grocery store employees, bus drivers, restraunt staff &amp; all others who are compelled to go to work every day &amp; risk their lives? Do we just not matter?"
"I 33f have been employed all the way through this situation in what has been defined as a vital industry. With schools, non grocery retail stores closing in lockdown situation, it feels like stores are not doing enough to maintain the physical and mental health of their employees. I am constantly stressed, rundown and as I live alone socially isolated most of the time too. Like other keyworkers we need some kind of emergency relief and preferential access to vital mental health services. It is also apparent how little I am paid for my services in comparison to many furloughed and working from home employees. I apologize if this is coming across as a bit of a rant but come on supermarket workers are worth more than a just above minimum wage and especially at this juncture."
"Was vaccinated a few weeks ago, first dose of Pfizer.  Did that lessen my symptoms? Also, have been careful all year. Suspect I caught it in the lunchroom at work, eating without a mask."
Who else feels like their best friends don't give a shit about us anymore? We used to see each other so often and now my friend barely even texts me no more. I kept trying to strike a conversation and now I gave up. My friends used to be so close but now we feel like strangers. Anyone relate?
"You know what the biggest evil of 2020 was? What drained you work wise and emotionally the most? Caused panic, distress and drained people of energy? One word... Whatsapp.First and foremost, having work groups on Whatsapp is a sin... You neither respect your agency peers lives nor your own. And neither do your bosses nor their higher ups. Its a vicious cycle of giving tasks, constantly checking the phone to see whether you have missed any important notifications and receiving and accepting work even on weekends, holidays and late at nights.I truly admire the people who can switch off their phone at nights and not lie awake just a little bit longer panicking on whether a slew of messages and missed call notifications will greet them the next morning. The little anxiety you feel if your phone is just a bit away and you don't know whether you have enough time to eat before the next notifications pops up. The pandemic took people pleasing to a high, the guillotine hanging loosely by a thread over your neck of getting laid off during the lock down times was enough to raise blood pressures, drain people of sugar and get people breathing into paper bags. What intoxicating noxious fumes of power were the leadership across countries getting high on I wonder? Enjoying the insecure movements of their employees and teams as they wondered how the bills would be paid.Sometimes I truly wonder, what happened to the 9-5's? The joy of coming home and re energizing yourself for another work day, of greeting your colleagues a happy weekend on Fridays? Has the work verse really gone that bad that we all have to work subserviently 24/7, 7 days a week regardless of whether our kids are ill, or meals need to be cooked and our partners asking for a little bit of our limited time?I really hope that this reaches out to all trapped by those little icons in this draining, miscommunication app to look up to the skies, smile more into your little one's eyes and not let the clutches of job security take you into its maws. You are talented, you know who you are, you know what you can do. Don't let fear and uncertainty take that away. And let us all ensure that we do not let instant communication kill our humanity."
Hello I am in 19-year-old and I unfortunately have a nicotine habit. I’ve been sick quarantining from Covid for the past three days and I haven’t touched any sort of tobacco/vape. Although as the days are catching up to me I realize it’s become more and more difficult to cope with this illness whilst also dealing with withdrawal..I want to avoid smoking anything as much as possible my lungs feel OK today it’s my third day... how far would it set me back if I smoke or Vaped anything?
"I work at an assistive living and my coworker died from covid today. She was only 65. There is 2 units and our small dementia unit became covid infested suddenly last month. Unfortunately, my coworker got covid and was put on a ventilator for 3 weeks. It makes me feel really sad because she was a sweet person who had served the company for 11 years. My brother worked there before I did, and she would always call us her son and daughter. I remember the last time I saw her a month ago; she was asking where her son was. She was always asking about us. It’s crazy how one minute you’re on the elevator with someone and the next minute they are walking into a covid infested place without proper PPE (we didn’t know at first, we only had KN95 masks on, then people starting to show symptoms.) It makes me wonder why did she have to be the one that was exposed and not me, a healthy 19 year old? It makes me sad all the things she’ll miss out on life like retiring, seeing normality again, seeing her kids or grandkids grow up. We have residents who are 100 and I think about the years she will now miss. She didn’t even get to spend a last Christmas with her family and she died alone.Edit: thank you for all the condolences. Sorry I’m not really up to responding right now. One of my coworkers definitely has covid, and 2 of my other coworkers might have covid. One of them is 60 years old, the other one is 40, and the other is 25. The 25 year old still lives with his parents and they have it. It feels like covid is around the corner, watching, waiting to attack me and my family. I also found out my work may not get the vaccine anytime soon. I am holding on to the little hope I have."
"Anyone else have Covid and the months after have confusion, forgetfulness, and brain fog?? I had Covid the first week in November and ever since I recovered I’m always forgetting things and confused. My fiancé will tell me  conversations we’ve had the same day and I won’t remember them or I’ll be in the middle of a task and always forget what I’m trying to do. A friend of mine said she had the same thing after she had Covid, but hers is starting to go away and I feel like mine is getting worse!"
"i want to thank my wife and family for being by my side and taking care of me during covid. it means everything im almost 100% to the sick ones, keep fighting, stay strong! you'll  get better!"
"Today I started having horrible chills, coughing and headaches. My body temperature rose and went down several times. Now it's 3:46am and I can't go back to sleep. I have a fever of 101.6.I fear for my wife, who is sleeping next to me. We don't have a way to sleep separate. The most I can do is sleep with a mask, looking away from her. At least the cough stopped, but the anxiety is horrendous. It pisses me off. I did everything right. Stayed home, wore masks when going out every time, respected social distancing. I even got to work from home for several months. Yet this damn invasive bug managed to get me anyway. I just needed to rant."
"I was diagnosed with COVID-19 almost a week ago, on the 4th of January.It's been a week of hell for me, my parents who I got COVID-19 from, are doing far worse than me. My father has pneumonia because of this which I hope and pray to God it doesn't become what the media portrays as ""COVID lung"".A few days ago, I actually felt like I may end up on oxygen; yes, it felt that bad even for a 38-year-old generally healthy guy. I pretty much had to force myself to eat, nothing tasted right. I didn't lose my senses, but they were certainly changed in some way. A couple of days ago I tried to smell fresh coffee ground which I usually like the smell of that, and they smelled like the most horrible thing in the world right then. The chills and the overall feeling of just feeling like shit was bad. I had a slight fever at one point, but the fever only lasted about a day or two. Surprisingly, I've been running below normal temp for a majority of having this thing.It's now the 9th, the feeling of being short of breath or at least my sense of heavy breathing has still exists. I've lost ten pounds already while fighting this thing. I wanted to lose weight but certainly not this way. I can only imagine that I'm going to lose even more weight over the next couple of days.Firstly, I always thought that COVID-19 was bad. Trust me. However, I never knew that it was ***THIS*** bad. My God in Heaven, I wouldn't wish this damn thing on my worst enemy. I'd gladly take the regular flu three times over this hot garbage."
"5 ppl in a family, living together, all came down with covid at different times. It is very clear on the websites, that ppl can leave their home 10 days after the first symptom and 24 hrs fever free. What I can't find is if say the first person contracted it on the first of the month and the last family came down with system 7 days later than the first...can the first person still leave the home 10days after their symptoms started, or should they wait until 10 days after the last person's symptoms started?Common sense would deem the first person could be carrying germs on their body from the 5th person out to the general public. I can't find any info on this specifically. I would prefer a cited source with a response. My background already tells me no one in the household should leave until the 10 days is up for the last person, but I need to prove this to someone else."
"Ever since quarantine, I obviously haven't seen them much. They never text me when I don't text them first. I considered them as close friends but idk anymore. I feel like it's my fault that maybe I ranted too much in the past and they got annoyed by me. So I decided that I wouldn't bother people with my worries and to just have better conversation. But I guess people won't even give me a chance."
So I’m so frustrated with what the hospital and everyone is telling me. I’ve tested positive for covid and self isolated. Waited 10 days from symptom onset and gotten tested again. Still positive. Still isolating. I’m frustrated because the doctors are saying that I can test positive for up to 3 months but if I don’t have symptoms anymore I can go back to work. I’m just confused. So does that mean you can be positive for covid and not be contagious? I’m really concerned now knowing that they are clearing people to go back to work who are POSITIVE. Anyone smarter than me have any info?
"I had covid, and have recently recovered from it. I’m feeling much better, the only symptom that seems to be sticking around is the difficulty breathing. Something I’ve noticed since feeling better: I canNOT sleep. I lie wide awake for hours. I’ve never had problems sleeping until now. I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but has anyone else who recovered from Covid had this problem? I am taking melatonin at night, I’m busy during the day, not sleeping in late, and no matter what I’m WIRED when it’s time to go to bed. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong but it’s really getting bad."
"Dallas TX, 1/10/2021 (( WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION WITH AFTER THE SECOND DOSE? ))TLDR: below.Wife is ICU Covid Nurse at a very large hospital in Dallas. She has been working that unit for about 10 months. She stepped right up for the first round of the vaccine right after it was approved. The first shot hag absolutely no side effects. She is Type-O, and has a very healthy immune system. She never gets the flu or a cold, giving a short simple history. So yesterday at 9:30 am, after exactly 21 days after the initial done, she got her second and final does of the PHIZER Covid-19 vaccine. She had heard form her colleagues that you feel bad and have a sore arm after the second dose. ""They"" (her fellow staffers) told her that it could be easily remedied with Tylenol, which she took last night and this morning. After about 8 hours after administration of the second shot, yesterday, she started to feel a pain in her arm and a bit tired. Last night around 9 pm, it had gotten worse with pain in the injection site, she woke up at night 3:30 am, we checked her temperature. She was fine but felt like a fever and very sore all over. This morning, she is on the couch and she can barely lift her arm and feels horrible, tired and feels like she has the flu. She works on Monday/tomorrow, and it will be a rough one as she has to move patients who are intubated/sedated (ventilator/medically induced 'coma'). She is concerned that she will not be able to do her job as effectively as being able to move people. She will ask for a lighter patient load. WHAT IS YOUR SITUATION WITH AFTER THE SECOND DOSE?TLDR: Covid ICU Nurse/Wife got second dose of  Phizer vaccine yesterday and she is feeling horrible and her arm is extremely stiff.  What is your situation dealing with someone you personally know post second dose of the vaccine?"
I have a sore thought and some muscle aches. Is this normal?
"Clearly, the fact that doctors and nurses have been wearing masks for decades and decades (to add to that, they work intensive 12 hour shifts) and there are no mask related injuries, the extra CO2 isn't a problem, but why would they think it's significant?"
"My husband is an assistant manager at a grocery store chain. He tested positive for Covid yesterday and submitted his paperwork to his employer. He worked the day before he tested positive. Today, he received a text from his boss (store manager) that told him he was not to make a FB post about having Covid because he was fathered under Hippa. We are aware that Hippa is in effect to protect his privacy. not the grocery store he works for. They would be liable if they publicly shared the information. We know they have to let employees know. But we don’t feel that his boss can tell him what he can or can’t post on FB about his health. We know his boss is just concerned with it effecting business. Thoughts? My husband just didn’t respond to the text."
"I was wondering how other people feel about seeing their friends and other people still go out and meet up and go to restaurants and other’s residences but still go and get tested because they know they’ve been going out so much. I have a group of friends in the LA area who sorta regularly meetup, with masks on? Going into each other’s cars and getting food or going to the mall to return things. I have some family members who regularly see each other and I think only one aunt gets tested before going places. I want to hear some experiences and responses because I’m feeling incredibly angry, jealous, and bitter seeing this happen and my family (household) has just been shut in at home (excluding the ones who go to work)edit: now that ive seen some responses, i think a lot of circumstances of people still going out but constantly getting tested is seeing a lot of the entertainment industry holding up that practice as they continue doing shoots (and some food service places?? i maybe wrong) theres obviously a lot of feelings stirred when you see people go out and for me the first one is anger as im not permitted to leave the house to see people as a courtesy to my family. ive definitely chosen to wallow and keep busy to manage the days so far until school starts again. its just been exhausted to thinking about a lot of it in this way??"
The new Covid19 guideline from CDC says we do not need to wash groceries. Is that 100% accurate? Has there been ANY case of Covid19 transmitted through fast food or groceries or mail?
"With remote jobs rising due to the COVID-19 situation, I have been compiling a free list of remote jobs every week.Last weeks issue: [https://remotists.com/newsletters/new-remote-jobs-at-on24-searchmetric-recon-ai/](https://remotists.com/newsletters/new-remote-jobs-at-on24-searchmetric-recon-ai/)I hope my little effort helps those in search of a job in these challenging times."
"I can smell like 50% of things around me and there's one scent that I can't get rid of. The smell I remember from childhood as the ""smell of sickness, like sweat mixed with medicines? This smell, it's all over my body, I smell it from my armpit, my fingers, my pee. I am not sweating excessively and don't take any medicines right now. Anyone had such symptom? My roommate says I smell just fine but I feel uncomfortable."
"I tested positive the week before Christmas and had a textbook case according to doctors. Symptoms and time frame, Etc. I still can't smell or taste but the body aches seem to have improved. The fatigue though is awful and I am sleeping more than I ever have in my life. Last Saturday I started with vomiting again and went to bed at 5 p.m. I woke up woke up at 3 p.m. on Sunday and my stomach was fine. I go to bed around 8 p.m. and literally sleep until the following afternoon, mostly around 1 or 2. I sleep through my alarm and eventually get up but two or three hours later I am exhausted again after doing nothing and end up back in bed until the next day. I'm fortunate enough to have a job working from home but I can't even get myself to the computer out of sheer exhaustion. I can't think straight and I'm doing nothing other than sleeping. Has anyone had fatigue this drastic? How do you deal with it and get through it? This is really affecting my overall Mental Health, work, finances, Etc"
"Is anyone else experiencing any mental symptoms from covid? I have minimal physical symptoms - nausea, diarrhea, extreme fatigue. Apart from that, I’ve been experiencing intense neurological symptoms. At around 7pm every night, I will start losing my words. I couldn’t think of the word formula, spaghetti and other words that I’ve used many times in my life. They completely escape me. I also start experiencing dizziness and delirious thoughts. I was eating a taco the other night with fajita veggies in it, and after eating my first two tacos, I bit into the last one and imagined I was eating worms. What in the actual hell lolThese thoughts have continued, out of the blue, only after 7pm at night until I wake up the next day and then they are gone. It’s almost like I’m experiencing sundowners. Has anyone experienced any mental or neurological symptoms with their diagnosis? I heard this only happens in about 10% of cases but my gut tells me it might be more"
"I can’t seem to find a definite answer or find if anyone has, but is it true that you can test positive months after having covid?"
"I live with a roommate and last week tested positive for Covid-19.  My roommate and I have been  communicative and believed we were prepared to handle the situation. She was supportive when I was symptomatic and awaiting test results with making me tea, sanitizing and asking how I was feeling. In turn I ordered her latex gloves and disinfectant sprays from Amazon so she didn't have to bear those expenses while I recovered.   Within an hour of officially testing positive, she ""about-faced"" and asked me to leave to apartment for her safety.  She said her doctor advised her that it would be ""best"" if I completed a full quarantine at my family's home an hour away because there were other positive cases.  I was understanding in the beginning, then felt profoundly disrespected.   I had a 101 fever, and there was no real safe way for me to transport myself there.I left anyway because I began to feel uncomfortable as she kept asking me for updates on my ""plan"".  My sister picked me up because she recently recovered from Covid and has a large SUV where we could socially distance, and I was transported to the basement in my parents house.  Everyone in the house has Covid except my Mom.  After 2 weeks recovering, I regret my choice to leave. I could have infected my Mom and it's weighing on my conscience. I had every right to stay in my apartment and I chose to allow my roommate to determine the best course of action for MY health.  I don't even know how to feel.  I do not think I want to continue my friendship with her and am looking for a new apartment.  I realize my boundaries need work.  Any thoughts / advice appreciated."

"I don't understand why everyone says something like ""I can't wait until 2020 is over"". Because the thing is, covid is NOT going to just end by the change of a day. I understand many people lost jobs because of covid. but people are still going to lose jobs. So don't say that just because it's 2021 everything is going to be ok. yes, there is the vaccine, which may or may not help. But seriously, a new year is not going to solve all our problems.Rant over.&amp;#x200B;I didn't mean for this to sound rude in anyway, I just feel that people don't think things all the way through before saying that"

Four other women backed up Hudson’s claims, and the jail, while denying a protest ever took place and maintaining tests are available, chalked the lack of clean laundry up to a “miscommunication” that a spokesman said has since been corrected."
"I had every intention to workout through covid if I ever contracted it, I always told myself that anyway.However, on Sunday I got a positive test for it and it has knocked me for six.Even going up and down stairs has got me panting and wheezing like I smoke 40 cigarettes a day.It's such a weird virus as it effects people differently. I have still got my sense of smell and taste fortunately"
"Hello, I got tested positive on Monday, Tuesday I ended up in the hospital due to shortness of breath, we're now on Friday and I bought a oximeter on the doctors advice when I was discharged. My worry is this, I still have shortness of breath, normally very fit walking a minimum of 3 miles to work and back but currently cannot walk to the toilet without losing my breath and needing to sit down. My resting heart rate seems to be sitting at over 100 and my oxygen is fine when resting, however, both my oxygen and heart rate seem to dip quite dramatically when I walk even the shortest amount.. I tend to be able to tell as it makes me feel faint, I don't feel like I'm getting enough oxygen but I don't really want to be a pain and go back to hospital, any advice? Thank you!"
"Me: My wife has pneumonia, we took her in last night. I won't be coming to work today.My Boss: did she test positive for COVID? Me: No. She has pneumonia.My Boss: okay, we will see you tomorrow at 8 then."
She’s in her mid 60’s and has exhibited symptoms all day yesterday and I’ve had to fight tooth and nail to get her to go to a clinic to get tested. now she refuses to self-isolate and continues to go out and be in close contact with other people. Is there anything I can do to force her to stay home?
"I am sure this has been addressed, but no taste or smell is unbelievably awful. It feels like life is instantly 50% less enjoyable. I am terribly depressed over it.If I have read correctly, something like 90% or more of sufferers get their senses back. Am I right about that? Does the severity of the Covid at all determine how long your senses are gone for? Or when you lost the senses? I lost mine on day 4"
"First, sorry for any typo or error, english is not my native language, so... Recently I was talking to my brother about Covid vaccine, and I've been watching YouTube videos about what they did, about this new technology and how they extract a part of the virus so our body will have a first approach and the rate of death will be lowered, however, despite the world needing it, I still have my doubts. To be honest I think we don't know issues in the long term and the vaccine was developed too fast (we have fought to various decades and still no cure, but also I acknowledge viruses and deceases have a wide range of flavors) and we don't know yet any secondary effect. Sure, showing public figures getting injected is reassuring but we don't know if it is the vaccine or a vitamin, believe me, in not trying to mount a conspiracy, but they are pushing too much about it to show it is safe yet we don't know but still need it, kind a dilemma here huh? So, can you share with me your thoughts? Im usually the first one to put my arm for a vaccine, but in this case I'm thinking about letting the first wave of people go, then get the injection (at some point I believe it will be mandatory, for travel for example) Additional note: to the ones who believe the dumb microchip conspiracy... Well I have to inform you that I was (still) one of the guys who think that will be really cool to have a pico LED light in your fingertips always on, but guess what, our body don't produce that amount of energy, so the only way to do it is to pack a rechargeable battery and deal with the risk of having that metal inside you, so there's no way a microchip can live within our body, except an edible pill with tech inside, and that will last a couple of hours, unless you are constipated, so good luck with that 😉"
"I’ve had symptoms since 12.30. CDC says 10 days and you’re free but I’m uncomfy going anywhere, how does it not spread?"
"At the start of the pandemic (after recovering from Covid, I got it back in March), I was doing all the right things to stay healthy both physically and mentally, but after 6 months until now, I can barely motivate myself to get out of bed and every day feels like a struggle. Anyone else feel the same and manage to pull out of it? How are you coping or pulling through?"

"Feel free to tell me if this is a dumb idea. I see there are people in my state struggling to get an appointment for the covid vaccine. I do not work and am decently tech savvy. I would love to try and help people who are legitimately eligible to get appointments, by making calls and monitoring the websites to try and get a slot for them. Of course, I couldn’t guarantee I’d be able to and I would use filler information for the personal info it requires and when they get the email confirmation they can go in and edit it to have their correct personal info. Is this a dumb idea?"
"I just feel this impending doom that life will never ever be the same, will we ever not be afraid of this pandemic? Will we be able to ever socialize like we could before?? My country has been crippled with covid since March of last year, we’ve come into the new year with more cases than ever and nothing is looking up... my mental health has since absolutely fallen apart, I feel so lonely, Being 21 I just feel like a year has just been ripped away from me, and it’ll atleast be another year before anything goes back to being even remotely normal... if it ever does.. I’ve suffered with depression for as long as I can remember and I never do well when I’m left with my thoughts, my family are people who aren’t very emotionally available, I always would talk to friends or meet up with them, but now I can’t see anyone, at the start of January I tested positive for covid, it was really those two weeks of isolation that really destroyed me, I’ve been sleeping most days and then awake all night and I can’t shake the bad thoughts away, I just feel absolutely helpless, suicide has crossed my mind more times than I can count, I’ve come out of isolation and got to see my boyfriend, I know it’s against the rules to see others but I literally cannot cope, I hate for this to sound selfish either but I’m sure most of you know this feeling, especially if living in a stressful home, but anyway sorry that this was a long and depressing read I just need to let it out......I also want to say RIP to all those who have died to covid, I know compared to that my situation is nothing."
fun fact : Covid killed more Americans than WW2
"**We've seen this play before. Americans suffer from a disease/influenza that impacts people at a high rate, doctors develop a vaccine and then the govt. uses celebrities as a vessel to promote the vaccine and quell the general population's reluctance.****This isn't anything new. Nor anything that should be unnerving. Back when polio was ravaging American communities, Elvis Presley received the Salk Vaccine on national TV.** [**https://4ormypeople.com/athletics/2021/1/19/nbas-adam-silver-discusses-covid-19-vaccination-of-players-as-psa**](https://4ormypeople.com/athletics/2021/1/19/nbas-adam-silver-discusses-covid-19-vaccination-of-players-as-psa)"
"I see you. I see you there alone in bed. Your eyes are tired. You can't even be fed. The mask is clamped tight to your face. Don't dare take it off. Not even for food. Oxygen levels dive with each sip of water.Your eyes are sad. Lonely. Afraid. When will this be over?I watch. I watch for signs. Are you sleeping?How fast are your breaths? Is your heart beating steady? What things make you hunger for air? Are your kidneys still working? What do you need?You weaken from the loss of food, of sleep, of touch, of hope, of love. I hear you. I hear you gasping. ""I can't breathe"" you yell beyond the torrent of air blasting into your mouth. The miserable thread left between you and life support. I hear your heart beat. I hear the words you can't say. They're written on your soul.I feel you. I feel your skin. So cold then so hot. I feel the changes. When your limbs swell. Hands and feet like water balloons. Pulses strong then weaker and weaker. I feel the struggle you're going through. I feel your frustration and anger. Your hope and thankfulness. I feel your willingness or resistance to my help. Your mind. It's slipping. You want to live! This will help. Grab this insulin syringe. The pain means you're alive. You need this! Stab! Stab! Stab! Your stomach now a mosaic of the tiny punctures and dots of blood. You're safe. We've wrestled the needle from your hand. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're so desperate. I wish I could take it away.It's happening again. You're worse. The treatments aren't working. Ventilation, sedation, paralization. Every medicine to support your body: tried and failed. It's been 3 weeks. Still; you're body demands more. More air! It's not enough! Your kidneys don't work anymore. Dialysis 7 days a week. Your heartbeat erratic now. Not in sync. The doctor calls your family. They come draped in protective plastic layers. They say goodbye. Medicine; Supportive treatments have failed.The tube is out now. You feel nothing. Just moments pass and your heart stops. Rest and peace have come. The pain stays behind you. Your family. Me. We carry that pain. The nightmares wake me. I see your faces. I hear your voices.I come back. The story repeats. The ups. the downs. The endless body bags. The news ping pongs. A little better, a little worse; but never good. It's always more suffering, more death. More trauma. No end in sight. I refuse to look for the mirage. All storms end, but this feels like the eye."
"I sequestered myself away with my family since last March. I wore masks everywhere, even outside. I exercised daily on my treadmill or walks in secluded areas. We were all careful.So what happened? Well I didn't get Covid but for me it was bad. I am blind in one eye due to a doctor's error when I was a kid. On December 30th, just 36 hours away from getting out of 2020 unscathed, it happened. Flashing lights all around my one good eye and then a bolt of lightening. I suddenly couldn't see through most of my vision in my one good eye.We went to the emergency room and then got sent to another. Finally found out after 9 hours of brutal tests with nothing to eat or drink in case of surgery, that I had a stroke in my retina. Nothing they can do about it. Here's a bill for $10k. Now go home.Three weeks later and the jagged vision has calmed down to a soft blind spot just under where I focus and it's not going away. But, here is the good news. I do have insurance, and I'm going to see a cornea specialist next month to get my long term blind eye fixed. By March, I hope to see again but from the other side. It will be surreal and I'm sure my brain will freak out over it, but it is good news in 2021. I hope you also can turn it around for the better this year."

"Not totally normal, I still get tired easily. My senses have returned completely and no more fevers or pains, except for a little coughing here and there. I can feel my soul coming back to me. I can finally eat and sleep. My wife still has a little bit to go but she's pretty much on the same boat save for feeling tired and coughing a bit more. I'm so relieved, so very relieved. Now time to be extra careful! Probably gonna need therapy after this. Thank you guys for all your support and the information you provided during my initial descent into Covid hell."
"Why don’t any of the pharma companies with approved vaccines give away the formula so other companies can just start producing it? With over 2 million dead, I would think the most important thing is speed and production levels.  Every company would still make money by selling what they produce (and actually save research money). Why are they all working on their own proprietary formulas?"
New to Reddit here so pardon me if I do this incorrectly.Ever since COVID-19 started to spread I have been working on making a more detailed and illustrative worldwide timeline videos of the spread and confirmed deaths as I thought it lacked. Showing India as one single data point is of limited value for instance. No really good existed in my opinion so I have attempted to make one myself. As it's a lot of work I have a long way to go to catch up with today. However I hope these timelines can be appreciated for how the first wave of COVID-19 spread across the world.Feel free to comment either here or on YouTube if you have any questions or comments.Have a look if you are curious:[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34QBZUiY1b94obNpcsBeog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC34QBZUiY1b94obNpcsBeog)https://preview.redd.it/eac5c1qty3d61.png?width=4500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b049c5e7856bbfb2822c452571c96965253ec25a
"So, my best friend just got over COVID, and went back to work this week starting Tuesday. I’m a little wary of her still being contagious, so I was wondering: how long is COVID contagious after you having it? She went through the 14-day quarantine and everything, but I just wanted to check. Thank you!"
Had covid 3 months ago totally fine and negative now but things smell/taste so bad - anything strong smells horrible and makes me nauseous any tips on getting my normal smell back? Please help thank you!Any tips or experience welcome thank you so much!
"I tested positive for covid-19 back in early April and had a pretty rough go. I was in the hospital 6 times and never fully recovered. Then back in November I started having breathing problems, bad brain fog, heart problems, and other symptoms. Now since Christmas my breathing has got worse and worse. Now most days my O2 stays around 84-88 and on bad days it's in the low 70s. I've been to the hospital 3 times and admitted twice. At this point I'm just waisting away I've lost 60 lbs I can't even make it to the bathroom and back without almost passing out. I have endless coughing fits. My brain is completely shot. I have no quality of life. It's just a miserable existence."
"Has anyone has COVID and NOT experienced a loss of taste/smell?I know this isn't a place for medical diagnosis but I'm also not 100% if I'm freaking myself out lmao. I have a cough and it hurts to breathe all the way in, and I'm fatigued despite being on a stimulant but that's about it. Yet everything I hear is loss of taste and whatnot?"
"Just curious if anyone who has had Covid and since recovered keeps smelling smoke? My husband keeps thinking he smells cigarette smoke. Sometimes it is so strong it will wake him at night. We are not smokers and it doesn’t just happen at home. It happens when he takes the dogs for walks, when he is at work and even in the car when he is completely alone.  Wondering if anyone else had had this issue."
"My dad had cardiac arrest and died yesterday morning, he didn't feel any breathing issues from what he told us and then it happens after roughly a week of symptoms.   Now my mom has it and we noticed her oxygen level wasn't good so we took her, she's now there for therapy but doing good vs it.  They hope they can let her out but a lot of unknown now. Which also means my family and now my greater family have to quarantine after going to hospital and seeing my father yesterday morning. This virus is horrible.  That's all I can say.  Wake me up from this nightmare please."
" On Tuesday April 24, 2012, a 45-year-old man with the surname of Guo was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit suffering from severe pneumonia. The next day a 42-year-old man with the surname Lv was taken to the hospital with the same life-threatening symptoms, and by Thursday three more cases — Zhou, 63, Liu, 46, and Li, 32 — had joined him in intensive care. A sixth man called Wu, 30, was taken into intensive care the following Wednesday. All the men were linked. They had been given the task of **clearing out piles of bat faeces** in an abandoned copper mine in the hills south of the town of Tongguan in the Mojiang region. Some had worked for two weeks before falling ill, and others just a few days. The illness confounded the doctors. The men had raging fevers of above 39C, coughs and aching limbs.

"Back in August I was diagnosed with COVID. It was a milder case, as my only real symptoms were sore throat and fever. Fast forward to today, I was diagnosed again. This time a mild fever, SEVERE body aches and malice. I tested negative several times since August. Is this an anomaly? Can anyone give me some insight on this.. really has my anxiety out of the roof."
So I was diagnosed back on the 15th. Aside from a stuffy nose my taste and smell are abysmal. I think everyday my taste and smell are very very slowly returning. It’s been about 8 days so far. What’s been everyone else’s experience? I’m seriously at my limit I can’t handle not having my smell and taste. I don’t know what to eat because I’m just not motivated to eat. I’ve been able to taste pedialyte pretty well along with ritz crackers. Everything else is just ... mush. I’m so scared seeing people say it takes months to get it back and even when they do get it back it’s not the same. I feel like my life is ruined I can’t stand it I just need some hope I’ll get better ... all I want to do is cry.
"Greetings,Hope everyone is safe and healthy.I tested positive for COVID-19 mid-November and about halfway through my stint lost all smell, which lasted for about two weeks. Since then, it's gradually returned, and everything was increasingly normal until last week, when some things began smelling/tasting horrendous. I can hardly describe the taste/smell as anything other than ""pungently metallic"".I noticed this trend in [another Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/hxs243/covid_recovered_people_has_your_sense_of/) and started doing some digging again. Curiously, it seems this distortion of taste/smell began for many of these people about a month and a half or two months after their initial loss of smell, which is about the same as [the 6-8 weeks that the olfactory epithelium takes to renew](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10896/). (It seems COVID-19 gains access to cells [via the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.204602v1), which are both present in the olfactory epithelium.)I also noticed that many of the people in that other Reddit post mostly complained about smell sources such as eggs, meat, garlic, onions, chemicals, and the like, to which I can attest. Most anything sweet, minty, or florally is clear and fine for me—but most savory/pungent sources seem to trigger the smellacious atrocity. This makes me wonder about the variable of [theorized smell categories](https://www.medicinenet.com/what_are_the_ten_basic_smells/article.htm).Has anyone else had this experience, and does anyone have any relevant information (some of which might help us figure out avenues of recovery)?Edit: I forgot to mention... I took a nasal steroid (Flonase) daily during the weeks leading up to this as well as Omega-3 supplements—the former of which I only stopped after this new symptom emerged, in fear that it had somehow caused it—and these seemed to help my smell recovery, though it's obviously difficult to separate that from the variable of time. I'm inclined to believe they helped, however, as things seemed to stall/plateau when I stopped taking the Flonase for a few weeks. I also smelled essential oils and nearly anything else I didn't think would harm me as often as I could.  "
"I don’t think I can feel anything anymore.  My mom has covid now too and I’m really scared. I am caring for her and arranging funeral plans while she is quarantined and now I’m afraid she or I am next.  Everyone from church is asking me if I need anything, but all I want is to say goodbye to my dad! He was diagnosed and brought to the hospital and passed away before I could say goodbye. Dad I love you, you know that I always loved you, you were the funniest and most wise person in my life and always taught me “do the right thing”. I love you and I’m sorry I couldn’t say goodbye but I hope you got my message I left on your voicemail. I love you so much!  I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you. I’m so sorry"
"It´s supposed to be a device kind like the infrared thermometer that can detect the virus by just scanning a person or objects. Seems to good to be true. [https://thecovidhunter.com/](https://thecovidhunter.com/)Does anyone have reliable information about this? seems to come out of the blue, just like that."
I started having COVID symptoms 1/20. A few days in I have painful lymph node swelling in my underarms. I didn't see this reported anywhere so I wanted to write about it so that if anyone else experiences it they do not feel alone.
"I just found out that my friend's dad, a doctor, gave him, his mum, sister and girlfriend ""spare"" COVID vaccines. I questioned how spare they really were considering people are dying because there aren't enough vaccines to go around. Turns out doctors are syphoning off secret stashes of COVID vaccines.Is this just a known thing that's happening?"
"A vaccination event in rural southern Oregon had to close early due to a snowstorm yesterday. The vaccine wasn’t all used but was nearing the time it would have to be discarded if it wasn’t used soon (it can only be out of the freezer up to 6 hours). The county health department was unable to get to the next town in time to administer the vaccines due to the snow temporarily closing the mountain pass. Instead of allowing the vaccines to go bad, they offered to immunize motorists who were also stuck on the pass.[County officials vaccinate motorists](https://ktvl.com/news/local/joco-health-officials-hand-out-leftover-vaccines-on-the-roadside-after-snow-closure)"
"I need help!! One of my coworkers tested positive for covid and had been coming in to work for at least a week with symptoms before getting tested. Our work did not make the rest of get tested since we “weren’t showing symptoms”. I pointed out that the CDC specified it could take 2-14 to show symptoms after being exposed. I then developed bad symptoms so I went to get tested. My test came back negative, but the doctor said it was possible it could be too early to detect. She also said that we had to quarantine now since we had been exposed. My supervisor and HR told us that we were not allowed to quarantine since we had no symptoms and my test was negative. Are they allowed to do that?? That’s specifically going against what the CDC recommends. Also should I report them to the health department or TOSHA? One of my coworkers is pregnant and another is the caretaker of her elderly mother. They’re being reckless and not providing a safe works space for us. Any info is super helpful!! Thanks!!"
"I posted about 10 days ago about having loss of taste and symptoms with 2 negative tests. (5 days apart both lab tests) Yesterday my boyfriend had a cough after not being out of the house and has come back positive. My sister who lives with us got a test today and is also positive. I rang a covid nurse yesterday and she advised that my isolation period is over and two negative tests are very unlikely he is okay going to work.Just a warning that even though my tests were negative I do believe I have covid and still do. I have woke up today feeling light headed, tight chested, headache and still can't taste. For the past 2 weeks I have had the below symptoms. Complete loss of taste (all day everyday) Tight chest (on and off) Sore throat (on and off) Breathlessness(all day everyday) Headache (on and off) Tenderskin (started last night)"

"I live in the greater Phoenix area - one of the most consistently active infection zones in the U.S. My wife is a nurse and recently took care of COVID patients in her hospital’s ICU, as she has often been tasked. “Terrible” is how she has described each experience. Yesterday’s was a little different.The nurses working with my wife confronted her for calling the ICU patients by their first names. “We do not do that,” they said, arguing that creating a human connection with COVID patients has resulted in a great deal of emotional pain. Their solution is to distance and detach themselves from the person in the room, because losing patient after patient has become “too much to handle.” Instead of names, they use bed and room numbers. Compassion and patient-centered care is at the core of healthcare and especially the nursing profession. That our nurses must resort to reducing the identity of their patients is very disheartening. “Disgusting,” even, as my wife put it. Her recent patients are not expected to make it, and she cried when telling me that she continued to call them by name for the rest of her shift. “They are scared and can’t be with their family. Acknowledging them is the least we can do when there is not much else.”AZ is already reporting more than 200 new deaths today. Each of these individuals has a family, a story, and a name. Please support and thank a nurse today, as they are carrying a very heavy weight and need it. And please wear a mask and get vaccinated as soon as you are able. Thank you for reading my post."
"I want to start by saying that i think learning about the pandemics of the past should actually give people more optimism. Seems like they all faded away except AIDS but condoms do combat that and also Covid has a vaccine unlike AIDSWeirdly enough i (like probably many others) moreso fear the people in the US and our government's lax attitude rather than the natural trajectory of the virus. 100 years ago that pandemic only lasted for a year and a half, but we didn't have airplanes or people likely traveling as much.i fear the people unwilling to get the vaccine, but my mom said recently she thinks the anti vaxxers will cave once they see how much it is helping societies open back up and lower cases. like they might not be loud and proud about it but they will probably discreetly inquire about it. i think she makes a good point.i do think/hope certain states will truly shut their borders to other states that are doing a bad job, it would break my heart that people that have been responsible will have to suffer further because Covidiots aren't being disciplined.i think as a planet we will eventually move on as all other pandemics came and went but i am confident this will keep happening and the US will keep being terrible at it. that's what i fear most. i'm someone who has been super isolated all year and got covid and lost my job. i can't go through this again. i want a president/governors who will shut EVERYTHING down the second this happens again. we never did a full shut down and have been half assing ever since.what i wish most that will never happen is the U.S fully quarantines for 3 weeks. except for hospitals and grocery stores but it's curbside only and everyone gets a headups to go stock up. at the end of the 3 weeks anyone with covid symptoms gets multiple tests (would love everyone to get tested to leave their house but we'll probably not have 340 milliom tests. it coule be so insanely easy to pull this off and we refuse to even do a measly 1 week quarantine. i truly (amongst other reasons) despise the US and think we are an embarassment.but i do think summer will be slightly better as we can be outdoors again and probably alot of clusters of society will have been vaccinated. will be interesting to see how lopsided the states become"
"I tested positive yesterday. On the same day, I lost my sense of taste and smell. There's absolutely nothing there except the constant faint smell of vomit. I haven't vomited so idk why the fuck the smell is always there. Does anyone else experience this?"
"People talk about the 1918 ""Spanish Flu"" pandemic often when talking about COVID, the masking laws, the anti-maskers, all the parallels. I wonder if we could talk to them, from the past, about our situation, if they would be surprised we didn't learn from their plight. But I also wonder about 2119. If this is a century cycle, if we go through this again in another hundred years, will our trials and lessons learned help, or will it again be a faded distant memory? Is our new technological group consciousness durable? Will our descendants see what happened, will they see the YouTube videos of people in lockdown, people mourning, people robbed of their future, tears for loved ones dying alone, will there even be a YouTube? Newspaper was old hat by the 1910s, but radio was new, would they have expected everyone to have heard and heeded a warning from the air waves? Is the cycle not viral, but our own hubris?"
"  When Pamela Addison's husband died from Covid-19 last April at age 44, she felt completely alone. She didn't know anyone her age who'd lost someone to Covid, and she hadn't seen stories about people as young as her husband, Martin, dying from the virus.Addison said she wanted to return the favor and write letters to other young Covid widows and widowers, but she was overwhelmed by the number of other young adults who had lost spouses.That was the start of the ""Young Widows and Widowers of Covid-19"" group on Facebook. Addison asked Scorpo to be an administrator of the group with her, and they soon had dozens of members. Today, there are 209 widows and widowers in the group -- all members of a club that no one wanted to be a part of.Source Link : [https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/us/young-covid-19-widows-grieving/index.html?utm\_medium=social&amp;utm\_source=twCNN&amp;utm\_term=link&amp;utm\_content=2021-01-30T00%3A16%3A06](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/29/us/young-covid-19-widows-grieving/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2021-01-30T00%3A16%3A06)"

"Let's start a thread of positive stories about the vaccine to combat the negative sensationalist ones some media outlets are churning out. I'll start first, I had the vaccine Thursday 28th January. I had a sore arm and sneezed a couple of times. No major side effects at all, all in all I feel grateful and optimistic. 🤞"
Is it possibly to get corona twice ???
"I read that after Covid vaccine we still have to wear masks as we might still spread the virus to others. At the same time, I read that we need to have a certain number of people vaccinated to reach herd immunity. How can these two news be both true at the same time?"
I manage a medium to high end restaurant and I am disgusted by the amount of people who will leave their used paper mask sitting on a table for someone else to clean up. I want to chase them down and throw it in their f'ing faces. If this disease is so dangerous why aren't their demands for proper disposal of masks?

How is it even possible?I know that here in London staff is allowed to work without a mask, as it is only compulsory for customers. But does it make any sense to refuse customers without a mask, when the staff is not wearing one? What is the science behind it?"
"I often thought Covid was like the flu...then I got Covid Well it has been over one month and I had Pneumonia and was tested and had Covid 19, fatigue, off work for one month, constant battle to catch my breath and coughing fits, fever, temperature, body aches... I feel lucky that I didn’t die but it was close as one night I was coughing so hard I stood up and passed out and did a face plant and had a carpet burn on my forehead.   I was too stubborn to go to the hospital because I thought that I would be put on a ventilator and die. I ended up back in the hospital a week later.

All six kids infected - no serious issues luckily"
Just got a call that my kid had close contact with someone at school who tested positive. Obviously they could t give any more information.  Parents- has this happened to your child?  If your child did end up with symptoms how long after exposure did they show up?  We’re on day 4. Any other family members get it?Really worried for my family. TIA
"Does anyone know how long immunity is supposed to last? I got over covid about a week and a half ago but a few days ago I started to feel sick again (congestion, sore throat and ears hurting but nothing a few pills couldn’t fix) I’ve always had bad sinuses and this has happened before but with all this covid stuff it’s making me paranoid. Is it possible I could have already gotten covid again?"
"I tested positive on 1/27 but my symptoms started on 1/25. I was told to quarantine for 10 days from the day I had my first symptoms. I am supposed to go to Florida on 2/19, but after spending (probably too much time cause now I am paranoid) on reddit researching other people's experiences I am super nervous I won't be better by that time. I have experienced headaches, random chill/hot sensations where I feel like I have a fever but don't. I had a sore throat the 2nd day after my positive result. One of the worst symptoms I have had so far is back pain and other muscle aches, but specifically my back is so sore. Another thing that has been rough, is sleep. I fall asleep so late at night due to anxiety and when I do sleep, I always wake up in such a weird state where my head feels ""dumb"".I am about 7-8 days into having this virus, and I just want to know when I will feel better and feel normal enough to do stuff. How long has it taken you to be able to get back to work and feel back to normal? Do you think I will be better by lets say 2/15 which would be 22 days after I started symptoms? It just sucks so bad to not see much improvement and it worries me I could still feel bad when I have things I need to do at the end of this month... Not to mention I need to get back to work and make some dang money!!!! Thank you guys. I wish you all happiness and health. :)"

Me on the other hand, I’ve been pulled out of my school by my parents and I 100% agree that I should be pulled out. But I have lost all connections with my friends for 10 months and it’s making me feel like I’m going to be the “new kid” next year when I go back. I know that this won’t be the case, I wasn’t a “unpopular teen” but it still makes me feel insecure that all my friends are building their friendships with each other while mine are getting lost. Are Any of u guys still distancing from other? I feel like it’s just me and my family but I know it can’t be completely true. Thx"
"I tested positive for covid in early January and I had every symptom in the book. I lost all smell and taste but now something weird is happening...I smell smoke ALL THE TIME.. and I mean stinky living with chain smokers cigarette smoke. First I thought it was coming through the vents of my apartment building but then I went outside, in my car, in the store and its all I smell :/Thus started a few days ago and now I'm a little freaked out and honestly having this smell stuck in my nose gives me wicked headaches...Has anyone else experienced this or have I just mutated beyond repair?"
"I’m 23 F and work in retail. My last shift was on Sunday and it was very busy with customers due to the snowstorm we had Monday-Tuesday.This morning, I woke up with a scratchy throat and mild congestion. I usually have a phlegmy throat from non-asthma related issues that’s on and off, but I noticed my dry throat wasn’t going away so I got tested. I cried when I found out I tested positive and immediately phoned everyone I worked with that day. I don’t hang out with people except my one friend outside of work and other than that I just shop with my mask on and I wear gloves sometimes. I’m scared though and I know two people who’ve had it and recovered with no issues but I would appreciate some encouraging words and advice to help me get through this. I do have an anxiety disorder and that’s not helping the situation, but I took a Zicam before I got tested and I have vitamin D capsules. I know there are no medicines for covid specifically, but what can/should I do (besides the obvious quarantine part) to recover with no issues?"

Myself as well as several others have worked with her multiple times this week, yet our employer says that there is no need for any of us to quarantine. This seems incorrect to me?

"Hi, I had a question for those who have tested positive or for any doctors who would know the answer to my question. I have test positive for Covid and my wife is immunocompromised. I have been quarantining for two weeks and I am no longer showing any symptoms. How long do I have to keep quarantining until I am able to be near my wife? I am scarred to come near her or our house because I do not want to be the cause of my wife’s death"
"How much longer will this go on?How much longer will it take before people snap and go batshit crazy?People loose their jobs, whole businesses crumble. People will get desperate really fast.How much longer can we endure before madness sets in without anything to do?After you watched all of netflix amazon prime and played all the games. After you build with your family a puzzle over and over again, you played all boardgames on repeat for days on end. How much longer can a mind take before it breaks?How many kids will be stripped of education because not all parents are able to teach their own children the way they need it.What's the point in living when there is no hope of freedom?We already had very little freedom and now this little we had we have been stripped off. How much longer before the protests turn into acts of violence and nonunderstanding? It's getting dark, very dark. Fucking madness needs to stop.."
"So looking at the death tolls rising and breakouts still hitting record highs why are people still so nonchalant about deaths? And why does compassion and empathy all of a sudden equal weakness? Are people really just okay with over a million deaths because it hasn't touched their families yet?The trolls on facebook are even worse, some of them still think this virus has a 99.99% survivability and will argue all day when you try and show them otherwise, nobody can admit they are wrong anymore. I was also told empathy is a women's emotion and pathetic that a man would show it. Like do we still live in the 1950s?Do we forget about all the great men in our history who have shown compassion and empathy? So called christians hail and praise Jesus when it works for them but don't actually live by the teachings offered up in the bible.I'm baffled by how America has gotten so angry and outright disgusting, if anyone has any theories as to why this is the case I'm open for a discussion. I really want to know how that side of the aisle is so devoid of any common sense, logic, compassion, and if I have to be rude...an education, what has happened to our world?"

"I find myself wondering what are the cases in a particular country throughout the day, but I had enough of going to these sites to find out and get ads and waste my time. So my Twitter now gets the data and replies.

"I had gotten covid-19 in mid December and ever since I have recovered all food tastes different... It's like I can taste the difference between processed foods because I had experienced no difference in taste as far as natural foods and drinks. But everytime I try to eat sweets, food such as TV dinners and even oven baked goods such as lasagna, they all have a common nasty taste that is starting to haunt me. I can't even enjoy Oreos, Chocolate chip cookies, or even Kit Kats... Is this only me?!"
"This is effectively a vent. My kiddo was born last week very premature in an emergency c-section. Mere moments after we get the news (of which I wasn’t originally in the room for at the ER because of this shitstorm) that we will be seeing our little one that day. My other kid’s daycare calls and says we must pick our child up ASAP because another kid in her class tested positive. Long story short the decision we have had to make is to effectively abandon one child over the other (and in turn put other family members at risk as well) or split ourselves up, one parent to a child, or simply not tell the hospital our child care woes and risk it. This decision is so amazingly heartbreaking I cannot express in words the difficulty only that we are doing what we can and constantly reminding ourselves. This is temporary. Are we ALL over it (COVID) emotionally? You bet. Please do your part for not only you (looking at a certain demographic that claims to be good folk but are usually only in it for themselves) but literally everyone so that my unfortunate scenario doesn’t need to continue to happen. Mask up for us all. Please. Vent over. Go back to whatever it is you’re up to. Popping probably."
"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  I found out that a family member's pharmacist friend is helping ineligible people in the current phase to receive covid19 vaccines (healthy with no co-existing conditions, not elderly, not working for healthcare or on the front lines - basically meets none of the criteria).  The pharmacist works in a retail setting and I can pinpoint the exact location and time of one of the appointments this upcoming Saturday to someone who is in her 20s-30s.  This is happening in an area where there is a real shortage of vaccines for the elderly.  Am I overreacting to this? Besides reporting the situation to a manager or to the corporate headquarters of this retail store, what else can I do or what is the best approach?"
Hi I'm new to the community I just wanted to coming to say something I am only 14 and I been in quratine since end of 7th grade and is coming up to the end of 8th grade I just want to go back to normal badly I miss sitting next to my friends on the bus going to the skating rink and actually not wearing mask I want to go back to a normal life where I don't have to where mask and social distancing can anyone give me good news to going back to normal please I need some good news all I here nows Is bad news or drama about politics please tell me some good news pleasessssssss
"My sister is currently in the hospital right now and has been confirmed to have it. I think my mom was the first one to get sick and said it’s not COVID but other things which sounds sus when there’s a pandemic now. My family and I got tested today and are waiting for a call back. I feel a sore/dry throat and pressure in my chest to stomach. For those who have surpassed covid, is it okay to take anti depressants or medicine to sleep? Just wondering..."
"I got Covid back in October. Lost my taste and smell. Took about month for it to go back to normal. Then in the middle of January, I noticed meats started tasting weird. It has this charcoal/gassy smell to it, and also tastes like it as well. This only happens when I eat most meats. Sweets, spices, seafood, fruits, carbs, and vegetables all taste normal to me. The smell of meat has become repulsive to me, and I can’t stomach it anymore. It’s been about three weeks  since I’ve developed this problem. Anyone going through something similar?"
Has anyone else had a bad reaction to the first dose and took the second? I’m taking the second for sure. A flu wrecked me and I’m guessing Covid would kill me and is why I’m reacting like this. I’m talking at least a week off next time.
"*explicit language because I am feeling a little sh*tty atm. TLDR if you don’t want to hear it, and have a great day!*For context, I am an educator that recently got my second dose of the Moderna mRNA vaccine, and am experiencing flu-like symptoms. There has been a lot of misinformation about what this vaccine does, so I thought I might set the record straight about what is happening in my body right nowNo, the vaccine did not give me the flu, or covid. It is currently making my body produce the equivalent of dummy punching bags with a picture of covid taped on the front (or at least Covid’s spike protein. The part of the virus that gives our cells a firm handshake of death). In response, my immune system is running a full scale, live fire, military exercise to figure out how to best slap all the covid dummies the vaccine produced out of existenceThat way, if I encounter the actual virus after this, instead of shaking hands, my immune system will give the virus a hearty bitch slap to the face, so I can get on with my day. TLDR: the vaccine made a bunch of inert covid proteins, and my immune system is slapping them around so much, that it is making me feel sick! It sucks...and I am so glad it is happening!"
"Hi All, Just had my first dose of the vaccine yesterday and wanted to document my experience so far!Day 1: I felt mild pain in my arm but nothing out of the ordinary with any vaccine. A few hours in, I started to feel quite “blob/potato-like” haha, very lethargic in other words. I ended up sleeping around 10pm and woke up at 5am. Such a change in my biological clock since I am a night owl and usually sleep around 2-3am! Day 2: My arm started to feel very heavy and sore, but I was full of energy and fine throughout the day. This vaccine definitely hurts the muscle more than the regular flu shot, but it’s now the end of day 2 and the muscle aches are going away. However, i’m starting to feel very lethargic again towards 8pm and I am beginning to randomly sweat. I also have quite an intense headache, and beginning to be nauseous. I’ve heard that these side effects should subside by day 3, and I’m hoping that these side effects sound normal to you?"
Anyone else feel uncomfortable taking part in random alcohol breath testing during this Covid 19 pandemic?I was pulled over earlier tonight for a random breath test and couldn't help but worry about the following.- Police officers not wearing masks or gloves and talking into my car window explaining the steps to me before testing. Definitely not social distancing.- How sure can I be that the mouthpiece wasn't touched or accidentally left on the breathalyser from the previous motorist. I'm sure these mistakes happen occasionally.- How sure can I be that the mouthpiece was handled hygenically when the officer isn't wearing any gloves and in a hurry to test each passing motorist.- Apparently if you breathe in over the mouthpiece there is a risk of breathing in droplets from the previous user of the machine. I'm pretty lucky living in Australia because there aren't many cases here but still...I feel that these kind of activities at the very least should be significantly modified to ensure a higher level of safety. It feels highly irresponsible to me. Thoughts?
"Same as title. In that light, this 'debate' about what form should the passport take kinda seems pointless when WHO already has a solution at hand such documents."
I am not providing link since I am not sure if it is legit or not. Has anyone used this? The website has social links but they just prompt you to share to tell your social circle to sign up. Seems fishy and my wife just signed up.
just found out I have covid ! Just wanted to let y’all know of a symptom you may not have thought would be a symptom : rashI woke up a few days ago with red bumps on fingers and elbows and they don’t itch or hurt and that’s a symptom I’ve never heard of until I just got tested Had a lot of other symptoms too but this one is weird
HiMy 23 year old cousin had the vaccine last week.. 2 days later he had a seizure.. followed by a second one.. he was rushed to hospital &amp; was in a coma. His kidney and liver was shutting down and he sadly passed away this morning My cousin had no health issues or allergies I have read up and been told by 15 people that their parents and grandparents passed after having the Pfizer vaccine. Does anyone have any information for people in their 20s having seizures or passing away for me to follow up on as I can’t find anything online yet
"idk if i'm putting this is the right place but i just need to rant. i fully believe this pandemic will never end (in the united states), at least until it's killed off as many people as possible. in the beginning, i was hopeful like everyone else. then i realized that trump disbanded the pandemic response team 2 years earlier. then there were people (the same people who were buying up whole grocery stores like it was the apocalypse) now believing it's a hoax and refusing to do the bare minimum like wearing masks and social distancing. then trump withdrew from WHO and trash talked fauci for no reason. and tried to nuke the usps because they wanted to hand out masks to everyone. don't forget celebs going on vacations to get away from their huge mansions. then the stimulus checks were dust, to those who even got them. then my otherwise healthy and lively grandfather died in a hallway because the icu beds were full.and now no more stimulus checks cause congress can't seem to agree on whether poor starving people who can't work in a pandemic deserve to live. also they don't wanna raise the minimum wage to match inflation and the cost of living, so the people who are forced to work and get sick still can't get by. yeah the vaccines are coming out but the rollout isn't great, and a large number of people are going to refuse it anyway.half a million dead and all we get are empty thoughts and prayers from the people who's job it is to help us. this could have been over. a while ago. i'm just completely drained. i'm still gonna follow protocol, i'm not an anti masker and i don't have anywhere to go anyway, but i'm just drained."
COVID Vaccine Survey Hey Reddit! I’m currently doing a survey for my Sociology class and need 25 responses to two quick questions. Question #1 Do you think the vaccine is safe? a.) Yes b.) No c.)

"Before COVID-19 I was a normal, mentally and emotionally healthy person, at the beginning of the lockdown, I took it pretty well but as time went along, I was demoted from a position that I really liked at my job where I had weekends off and I was demoted to cleaning, sanitation position where I had my weekends taken away and had to stay until 8, I know that this seems unimportant but this was a huge inconvenience to me and I was very upset, my poor emotional impulse control caused me to quit, I later got a job which I hated, so I called in a bunch and got fired, other than losing a job that I loved due to the pandemic and my inability to control my emotions, I also lost all my hobbies, I was in two flag football leagues and ultimate frisbee, which was my escape and hobbies I enjoyed dearly, I also got into a relationship which was a few months old when Covid started, over time all these losses, the stresses of a relationship and not having these escapes caused me to experience anxiety and depression, my relationship started to struggle and a lot of issues from my past started to manifest itself on top of it, this is no doubt the toughest time of my life and I’m just wondering if I’m not alone."
"56YO physician here. I work with covid patients in the US, but I never got the infection. Got my vaccine doses in the US on 12/15 and 01/08. Last week took a test to measure antibodies. The test results are expressed with a number: if its less than 15 you don’t have antibodies. Between 15 and 80 you’re protected. Above 80 you’re hyperimmune and you can actually donate plasma to help other people. My results showed a level of 224. Result: it worked and I’m happy I had the opportunity of being vaccinated."
"My friends and I were looking at case numbers around the world and noticed a handful of countries that happened to similarly decline after January 11-13th. Countries such as Mexico, Poland, Japan, US, UK, Germany, Canada, Argentina, South Africa, etc. Maybe we’re just a bit paranoid and curious but it just seems odd considering how different these nations are from each other. We can recognize that it’s after the holidays and what not but there are a lot of inconsistencies, what are we missing?"
"My grandmother has bad dementia and has been in a nursing home since April 2020. I haven't seen her since February 2020. The nursing home will only allow visitors to stand outside of her room and talk to her through the window. She gets very confused and upset and starts crying and begging to leave. I just want to hug her. I havent seen her in so long, because even the window visitors are limited. I understand how serious covid is but is it really worth destroying the final years of her life? I just want her to be happy. :( Covid sucks."
"I am 19, and just got offered a job in another country. It has always been my dream to travel the world and this is an amazing opportunity for me. Still we are in the middle of a pandemic and I don't know what to do. The people i am in contact with, keep reassuring me that everything covid related is safe and and responsible.As it is a business related travel it is permitted both by my own country and the country I'm travelling to, to travel if I have an negative test and are isolated 10 days after arrival.For this job I would be relocating at least for a year and therefore moving completely. Now I have to either give up this amazing opportunity to get a step closer to my dream both professionally and personally or move to a whole new country in the middle of a pandemic.What am I supposed to do?Is it responsible of me to make move even as every authority says it's okay? I'll be leaving everything behind to be quarantined and work from home for as far in the future as anyone can predict... is it worth it?"
"I am female, 44 years old. I live in a household with my parents, sister and her husband. My sister, father, and mother all tested positive for covid. My mother had no symptoms and my sister and father both fell ill with typical covid symptoms. Covid killed my father and my sister recovered. Both my brother-in-law and I tested negative for covid. He had zero symptoms. I had flu-like symptoms at the exact same time as the other sick people in my house. Dry cough, pink eye, congestion, exhaustion. I thought the negative test must’ve been incorrect. I’ve had two antibodies tests in the weeks and moths after and was certain I must’ve had Covid. They were both negative. How is it possible to share a close space with covid infected and not get Covid? What are the odds I had the flu at the exact same time as being exposed to Covid!? 🤔"
"My understanding is that animals can also get covid. It started in either bats or snakes? I’m not certain. And then the virus jumped to human. I remember reading that cows and whales can get covid. So if animals are susceptible to contracting it, can we vaccinate them so they don’t die from it? Are the current vaccines that are available safe to use on animals? My understanding is that the way vaccines work is by giving you small doses of the virus so your body can produce antibodies and you won’t did from it. Can animals be vaccinated with the same vaccines used on humans? If not, would it make sense to produce vaccines and deliver them to animals? I’m unsure what the discussion around non human death to the virus has been. I am almost positive animals can contract the virus. I hope someone out there is tracking data for animals testing positive and the rate at which their symptoms persist and if any deaths in cats or dogs has been recorded. I actually just googled and yes, animals can get it. So if they can get it, would it make sense to vaccinate them to prevent them from dying? Obviously research takes time, and we need to track how the virus has been in animals to determine if the death rate is alarming. If perhaps the situation is how it is with children, I believe children mostly do not get the virus or don’t develop severe symptoms and tend not to die from it? Unsure if this is true but if the case is similar in animals in that they don’t react intensely to the virus and remain persistent, its not an issue. But if the health risks for them is similar to that in humans. Say long term lung problems, neurological issues, I’ve heard covid can affect the liver, we should vaccinate them. Its a virus that manifest in many ways in many people. Its like everyone has a different reaction. In many ways, I feel thats helped spread a lot of misinformation and fear about the virus, no? Because people’s reaction to the virus varies so greatly some feel the virus is illegitimate, somehow. But regardless, if animals do suffer prolong health problems as humans do to this virus, would it make sense to vaccinate them? Have academics, doctors, or veterinarians been talking about this issue? Have homeowners who have had their animals test positive for the virus notice any changes? I’ll say my cat has not been tested, I believe my mother tested negative as has my father and I have never tested and admittedly had my face mask down while around a few friends a few times. Not like most people I almost always have it on but there were some moments in car rides with people where I let it down. Whatever point is I don’t believe I have it but my cat has been sniffling and coughing more than he has in the past. Since the pandemic started I have noticed both cats cough far more than they did before the pandemic. Nothing major they both seem fine mostly but they do cough more than they have before. Should we vaccinate animals?"
"Just sharing that I have got diagnosed with Shingles about 2.5 weeks after receiving the first dose of the Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine.. just wondering if anyone who received the vaccine have experienced this? I am a male, 29yo, with no major issues with health."
"I work in a coffee stand - a super small one. Probably like 6ftx8ft. Everyone works their shifts alone. No one wears masks when they’re working their shifts except for me. (We’re supposed to, obviously). My question is, if the person working before I come in isn’t wearing a mask for their entire shift &amp; has covid, then I come in and work my whole shift with a mask besides taking water breaks, doesn’t it seem likely I would get covid regardless of the mask or not?I know the mask won’t hurt but since it’s such a small space I feel like the droplets would get in my eyes or just on my face somehow and infect me regardless.Of course no one can say for sure, but what are your guys’ thoughts?"
"**Why don't Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and others share the formula of the vaccine with other pharmaceutical companies so we can end this pandemic faster? Don't they understand the risk of having a new strain that's resistant to these vaccines.**"
I am a female (18) and I have two siblings 17 and 15 my mom was talking about going to Florida (Disney world) because flights were cheap and I told her that it was irresponsible regardless of ticket prices. She said that I was right and trashed the idea. My sister was mad at for it but she got over it. That same weekend I went to my cousins house and when my mom came over to their house to pick us up. She said she had planned a trip to Vegas for me and my cousins (6 people) and bought all of the plane tickets. I talked to her about it and she claimed that we would be safe and that we would wear masks. A couple of days later I told her I didn’t want to go. She said I had to because-1. She bought my ticket already. 2. I’m not able to stay at home with no one with me across the country. 3. I can’t ‘live in fear’ of covid.I feel like a horrible person going on this trip and I feel that no one around me is taking it as serious. What do I do?
"I feel like our leaders put no thought into how shutting down the country would affect people in the long term. I don’t see the country going back to normal anytime soon and I don’t even know what “normal” is anymore. I get that they wanted to avoid as many deaths from the virus as possible but how many people have fallen to addiction, suicide, depression, and lack of motivation from being locked up inside? They should’ve just made it so that if you’re a high risk person, stay inside. Why do the people who are not going to die from the virus have to stay locked down? As a college student, my motivation decreases every day and I know for a fact that I am not doing as well as I would in normal circumstances. I’ve had to switch out of my engineering major because the online learning environment is trash and it’s impossible to learn something as difficult as engineering over zoom. It’s making me wonder how the timing of this virus and the response from our leaders is literally going to change the course of millions of people’s lives but all people worry about is the number of cases. I don’t mean to sound selfish and I know families have been torn apart by this virus, but what I wanna know is how many peoples lives have been torn apart by the government response.Edit: people have been responding with this article and I thought it was a good read [article](https://www.aier.org/article/why-i-believe-that-covid-derangement-syndrome-is-real/)"
"My dad has his first dose of Moderna on Friday at 1pm, tomorrow afternoon it will be 3 days. He’s got a bad fever, shaking, sore arm and neck (all normal symptoms) except he is reporting also a “deep painful cough”. That’s not normal.He is 65+ overweight diabetic and a retired firefighter that was at 9/11 but recently got a lung CT scan and was told everything looked fine.I am really worried about him. He said the doc gave him a Xanax and he took it but is trying to sleep upright since it’s worse when he lays down. Cough developed late last night he said. Is anyone else reporting a cough after the vax? He’s also the only person I’ve heard of having a bad reaction in dose 1."
"I'm seriously pumped about it! Can't wait to be fully vaccinated!So heres an update to hoe I'm feeling: So I just wanted to update everyone on 22 hours after I got the second dose of the vaccine. I didn’t feel anything  at the injection site  until I took the bandage off prior to showering. Once taking the bandage off I could really notice a slight soreness coming on. By 8pm which was 12 hours after the injection the soreness really pronounced. It was somewhat bothersome while trying to sleep. That night I'd get super hot and I started sweating...then I'd start getting cold. The back and forth continued well into the next day. I also experienced slight nausea. I also felt like I got hit by a train and just wanted to stay in bed all day the next day, however I had to report to work. Aside from that It has now been 22 hours since the injection and I'm feeling like my old self again."
Is it true?And how have you guys handled covid where you're .it makes me worried when you say things are worse that side.I pray and hope the situation goes back to normal

"The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement yesterday reiterating ethical concerns over the newly authorized Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine: [https://www.usccb.org/news/2021/us-bishop-chairmen-doctrine-and-pro-life-address-use-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine](https://www.usccb.org/news/2021/us-bishop-chairmen-doctrine-and-pro-life-address-use-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine).As the Conference said of the AstraZeneca vaccine in December 2020, the statement noted that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine “raises questions about the moral permissibility of using vaccines developed, tested, and/or produced with the help of abortion-derived cell lines.” Though such cells are not actually in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine (in other words, the vaccine is not developed from aborted fetuses as some have claimed), the Conference noted that such cell lines were used in the development, testing, and production of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. By comparison, those cell lines were only used in the testing of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Despite these ethical concerns, the Conference stated that where there is no choice, it is morally acceptable to receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. However, if the option is available, the Conference encouraged that Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccines should be chosen over Johnson &amp; Johnson’s.  As it has in the past, the Conference reiterated the importance of getting vaccinated, saying that “given the world-wide suffering that this pandemic is causing, we affirm again that being vaccinated can be an act of charity that serves the common good.”Ethical concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines, are nothing new. They’ve been discussed for some time, even when not covered in the media. They are one part of the challenge Americans will increasingly face as they are confronted with choosing from multiple vaccines for COVID-19. Add to this issue other questions about which vaccine is more effective, safer, and faster. We are beginning to see what Dr. Gregory Poland, the director of the Vaccine Research Group at the Mayo Clinic warned of last fall regarding the many emerging vaccines, “It has not yet dawned on hardly anybody the amount of complexity and chaos and confusion that will happen in a few short months.” ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/health/covid-vaccines.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/health/covid-vaccines.html))"
"22 (Black, F). I contracted covid December 27 and recovered in January. I am now eligible to get the vaccine and I don’t know which to get? J&amp;J or Moderna? What would y’all recommend?"

" As of March 3, 90% of the Covid deaths in Oregon are seniors, yet seniors have received only 20% of the vaccines. Where is the science that indicates that focusing 80% of the cure on 10% of the problem is an effective way to reduce Covid deaths? It seems to me that applying towards 90% of the cure to 90% of the problem is a more effective strategy to reduce Covid deaths in Oregon."
"I got an email from Steve Kirsch, whom I consider one of the more brilliant minds of our time on par with Einstein and Feynmann.  He founded Infoseek, invented an optical mouse, contracted Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia and set up a foundation to seek a cure for WM (on a pretty rational basis of dollars spent to people afflicted) and even though his background is EE/CS, he delved into the medical world and provided key direction in that fight.  After COVID hit he started a new foundation dedicated to finding early treatments using existing drugs, since the trials that existing drugs have to go through are much less time consuming since safety parameters are already known.  The trials were on the basis of people who had become infected but not hospitalized, to find tools that work early in the progression of the virus.  You can read about the  foundation and it's work at [https://www.treatearly.org/](https://www.treatearly.org/)  They have had promising results with two common drugs, some of it is now published in established medical journals.Kirsch didn't indicate in his email what the 60 Minutes segment would be about, but if he's involved it is bound to be interesting."
I got covid back in December. I tested negative in January and to this day I have symptoms. After covid I got a sinus infection and I have experienced headaches almost everyday since. I am getting an MRI on Tuesday and a CT scan soon. Symptoms:Small periods of nausea Headaches/migrainesSinus pressureAnxietyFatigue Has anyone else experiences these long covid symptoms?
What do you guys think happens when people do not show up to their covid vaccine appointment? Do they give a the left over vaccine to who ever else shows up even tho they are not qualified at the moment?
"Ok, I’m ready to hang out with vaccinated friends.  I’m tired of this life and sadness. It’s made me look and feel old and pointless.We’ll wear masks, probably start just outdoors. That means we’ll likely get sick of masks and take them off. We’ll stay socially distanced until a few beers in, at which point we’ll hug. Eventually, after a few good times together, I’m sure we’ll get tired of just being outdoors and come indoors with masks. And, of course, the masks will come off after a visit or two. So... Thoughts?"
"Hello there, I received my first dose of AstraZeneca covid vaccine.. and now I'm very sick (fever, muscle pain, headache.. etc).. is it ok to take an antipyretic to reduce the side effects or this will mean the vaccine will be useless because I didn't let my body develop the immunity?thanks in advance"

"People are debating about the safety of schools and the inevitable rise in R rate opening them would cause, there is even discussion about intermittent lockdowns or winter lockdowns (requiring schools/colleges to be shut) that will happen because of this “experiment.” Do you believe it’s a mistake and could lead to further lockdowns?"
I’m getting vaccinated on Wednesday. One of the first four million to get a J&amp;J shot. Should I anticipate an inoculation card? Excited to be done with this lmfao
"This continues to be a battle after testing positive in December. I have ADHD to begin with which makes it a thousand times worse. My provider recommended an omega-3 supplement and a ""clean diet"". She said outs all related to inflammation and should help. Does anyone take a supplement? Fish oil? Krill oil? Anyone change their diets to help with these symptoms?What are you doing to help with these symptoms? What works and what hasn't? Thanks in advance for your input."
"As states across the country are widening availability of COVID-19 vaccines, Alaska became the first state to announced that it would provide the COVID-19 vaccine to any resident over 16.  The state leads the country in administering COVID-19 vaccines by population ([https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)), but has reported that vaccine appointments are going unfilled.  Hopefully this will be the first step in other states with high vaccination rates can soon follow suit (New Mexico has the next highest rate).  Nationally, it is anticipated that enough vaccines will be available for all Americans by sometime in late spring.[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/10/975535053/alaska-opens-vaccines-to-everyone-over-16](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/10/975535053/alaska-opens-vaccines-to-everyone-over-16)"

"So, I've been dealing with Covid for at least 5 weeks now, and I'm feeling better. My lungs definitely suck at breathing now, but I'm doing better. What I'm here for, though, is that while my cough is nowhere near as bad as it was when it began(in fact, the cough is only mildly frequent at night and/or happens when I eat something cold), I'm unsure about something.I admittedly think I've still got Covid and yet will try and get tested when possible just in case(I don't have a car and the only way to get tested in my area is at a pharmacy drive thru), but is it possible that the lingering cough can happen even if I don't have Covid anymore? Asking cause I'm admittedly not finding much about it online. Although, there's one link about phlegm being coughed up to clear the lungs, which I think I got most of out of my system by now.Any help with this would be greatly appreciated, thank you."
"Today I had gotten my Covid vaccine (Johnson and johnson) couple hours, maybe 5, my body is aching all over and I feel very cold. Is anybody else felt or feeling this?"

It looks like without a vaccine multiple PCR tests will be required for travel in the summer.Does anybody know the most cost effective way to get these? Should be around 6 of us if buying in bulk helps
"Initially, my state started with healthcare workers and people 65+ only. But today, I got the email stating that the qualifying recipients have expanded to include people with underlying medical problems that would make a COVID battle significantly worse. I started out by following the instructions in the email: Go to an official website, click some things then await further instructions.Excited by the news, I sent a message to a friend of mine letting her know about the expanded vaccine news. She has a qualifying underlying condition, too, so I figured she should know. This friend, in turn, showed me a way to get the vaccines scheduled EVN FASTER. I now have both vaccines scheduled, and the first one is tomorrow. I'm so excited I can't sleep. Now I don't have to worry about being around other people (when it's unavoidable), and either killing them or dying myself. YES!Edit: My state is Georgia."
"Anyone else having trouble focusing after a year of covid?I use to read a book a week, now I can’t get through a chapter!"
"It seems there's a range of reactions people have been having in response to being vaccinated, ranging from relief and excitement for the future to anxiety and feelings of guilt.So how are you vaccinated folks out there doing, really?NOTE: This is NOT an anti-vax thread. Please get vaccinated! I'm just checking in on the emotional well-being of my people. "
"I need some help understanding all the info out there, as I've seen different answers on different sources. I'm trying to figure out if I even need the vaccine, since I've already had COVID (in late October). I've read that the vaccine doesn't protect you for very long, so I'm not sure if/why I should get it since I already have memory cells. I'm not yet eligible for the vaccine, so cannot get it at this time. Not looking to argue with anyone, I genuinely am trying to understand the science here. Thanks!"
"I just wanted to say this, its not important but I just wanted to share"
"My dad is in the hospital battling the scars Covid left in his lungs, does anyone has a similar story? the doctors say covid is not even the problem anymore, the problem are the scars left on his lungs"
"Hello reddit, I'm so excited to see so many people in my area getting their first dosses of the vaccine!My dad has been high risk since the day this pandemic started, and me being a teenager, had to make so many adjustments to my life to keep my family safe and everyone around me healthy, body and mind.At first my father's cancer treatment was going so well and our amazing western medicine was able to wipe everything from his body safely and make him himself again, until unpredictably, his cancer came back and this time things got more serious, something like this has never happened before to someone with this type of cancer that he has. He was scheduled for major bone marrow transplants and for ports to be put on his chest and day after day going to hospitals, different ones every week. Right now he's so fragile that if he breaths in a spec of fungus or bacteria it could ruin him. This is a lot to be happening to my family and most importantly, my father. I can't imagine what goes on in his head right now, as he's pretty hard to read and not very open.This pandemic has pushed my whole family to our limits, I'll spare the details of some of the mental struggles we've gone through.I want to thank every person who has felt the pain of this pandemic and for staying so strong, my family would not be here if it wasn't for everyone being so cool.and a special thank you to all the doctors and nurses and medical people who study and treat cancer. You've made an immeasurable difference in my families lives and I can't thank you enoughand finally, the people around me are getting vaccinated and the daily anxiety i feel is starting to fade. Soon i will hug my friends, and i will get to hug my father soon and i just can't waittl;drThis year has been so hard, expecually living with a father who's sickness puts him at extremely high risk.I want to thank every single person who has done anything to help protect the people around them from covid, be it wearing a mask or just anything to protect the humans of earth from covid.From the bottom of my heart, thank you."
"&amp;#x200B;Hello,This  is my first post, and I don't know if I am posting in the right place.  First, I am interested in understanding the scientific reason for  relaxed COVID restrictions. In my state at least, the government has  decreed that children in school may occupy the same space within a three  foot radius of each other. It has previously maintained that a six foot  distance was necessary to limit the spread of the virus.I  would also like to ask if the following hypothesis is possibly true. It bothers me, given my ignorance of the reasons for  relaxing COVID restrictions, that it is suddenly acceptable to do so. A  thought that has occupied my mind since the start of the pandemic has  been that these restrictions have a psychological purpose rather than a  medical one. It seems to me that the upper class of American society  subscribes to an Ayn Rand-inspired ideology. My thought is that the  purpose of social distancing, while inspired by the very real virus  threat, has a dual purpose of reducing the human empathy habit by preventing  people from interacting physically as well as blocking them from reading  each other's faces (masks) for a period of time. If I were a Rand fanatic I would work to  build my ideal world by changing human nature to reflect my idol's  preferences.I  am hoping someone on this forum will be kind enough to put my fear of  the above to rest as well as inform me of the medical reason for reduced  restrictions."
We just took him there today after his doctor recommended it. Are the odds with him or against him?
"I just am posting this to spread more awareness, I am very aware that I am able to still contract the virus regardless of getting the vaccine, but most people are not aware of that. The other strange part is my dad, mom and step mom (so no blood relation) all received the vaccine around the same time as me and are also all positive right now with symptoms. I am grateful that I have no symptoms as of now, I tested positive almost a week ago now. Anyone else have an experience similar?"
" This is me originally from the covid long hauler's sub reddit but I figured I'd post it here too. I strongly encourage anyone who is struggling to go check out the recovery page there. Anyways, here it is...Hello everyone,First off... **God**, **grant me the serenity** to accept the things I cannot change, The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference. lolBut seriously this recovery thread is like the AA nation right now for covid long haulers. It has helped me tremendously in my understanding of what's happening to me, and has reduced so much stress &amp; anxiety that I was having at the beginning of this journey.I'm a 20-year-old male at college right now and I got Covid a little over a month ago. I've always been fit, played sports all throughout high school, live a relatively healthy lifestyle. My initial covid symptoms were super light... just minor cold symptoms. But about two weeks after I was out of quarantine my knee started randomly swelling. There was no trauma just random. For the next few days, my head started feeling weird. I couldn't focus, I felt super tired, I couldn't remember words well. I wrote in my journal... ""what the hell is wrong with my head"". My roommate saw and I'm sure he was close to sending me to the loony bin.It was a few days after that when I started waking up in the middle of the night. It almost felt like when you hold your breath for a really long time and you start to feel tingling. I'd be dripping in sweat and my heart would be racing crazy fast. I ended up going to the ER because I thought I was having a heart attack. They did an EKG and found nothing wrong with me. I left and went home scared to my core. This kind of repeated with weird symptoms like tingling, itchiness, neck stiffness, dull headaches, and like my skin was icy hot up until last week. I ended up getting blood work done and having a CT scan with ink done... which also turned up nothing. Since then I've been scouring the internet looking for solutions and info on what the heck was wrong with me. Which is how I found this place.It's been a battle. I'm still only a month in. But I will say I feel a lot better now. Sleep has been key. Eating right has been huge as well. I returned to work this past weekend and it was pretty difficult, but it felt good for me to be walking around and interacting with people. It comes in waves and sometimes it's extremely frustrating at times. But I will say this, and if there's anything I want to accomplish from this post it's what I'm about to say... you will get through it. As Matthew Mccnoghay beautifully puts it... ""you'll get through it cause you got to"". You are stronger than you know and you have the will to live on. I've never had to will myself to be alive and conscious as much as I've had to in this last month. But because of that, I feel that I've become a stronger person because of it. That lesson may be the symptom of Covid that stays with me the longest.Have faith in yourself, everybody. Wish you all the best. It's a journey but we'll all be here with you. Best of luck to you all. Peace."
"My dad tested positive, and was in the same house as me and my mother for roughly 10 days before being sent to the hospital. My mom (age: 50s | weight: obese | high blood pressure) has a scratchy throat, keeps clearing her throat, and occasionally coughs. We both were tested today and will be getting the results soon, but I'm not sure if they would be accurate due to the fact that the test was taken when little to no symptoms were present. Assuming the she does have it what should the plan be?  We both already take supplements for zinc and both vitamins D and C, and are both wearing masks. Should we be doing anything else to try to prevent spread/severe illness?"
"There are currently 13 DMV centers closed in NJ.  3 local high schools have just pivoted to all remote learning for the next 2 weeks due to covid. I guess one year later I am still questioning end game here..... is this how it’s going to be from now on? I can’t imagine returning to my office, getting exposed, needing to quarantine and the cycle goes on and on.  Even vaccines are not 100% so what happens now????"
"I'm 7 weeks pregnant. 2 weeks ago I got the first dose of my Covid vaccine (Pfizer). 12 hours after getting the shot, I woke up and passed out in the shower. I'm not one who usually passes out. I was extremely lightheaded for about 3 hours and then was extremely, extremely sore the rest of the day (could hardly walk).My question is -- has anyone else passed out around 12 hours after their dose of the vaccine? My doctor said it's an atypical reaction and is thinking I should not do the second dose and restart the series after the baby.I'm completely torn on what to do."
"Well, I'm 54 years old, was born with a genetic heart defect and I've been virus free since this pandemic started. From the start, I've been on the fence about the vaccines that are out there with one drug company's vaccine killing people, another causing blood clots and even my sister who works in nursing homes as a CNA, has had elderly patients die from receiving the vaccine. She has continued to advise me not to get the shot.Then, today, I get a phone call from my doctor's office wanting to set me up with an appointment to get the vaccine. I declined. Nobody in my family has contracted the virus yet and I'm scared to death of getting the vaccine and then having my health problems escalate.I've been diagnosed with sleep apnea, permanent vertigo, permanent daily dizziness, borderline diabetic, heart problems and trying to lose some weight in the process. I'm just not convinced that the vaccines out there are safe and even AstraZeneca has been caught fudging its own data on the efficacy of their vaccine. Thing is, my fear of the vaccine doesn't comer from being an anti-vaxxer, I'm not one of those fruitcakes. I'm just not convinced that there has been enough testing to ensure the vaccine is safe."
"Like it’s easy, wear your fucking mask, this kid in my class legits uses his friends vapes, doesn’t wear his mask, and when he does wear a mask he wears it under his nose or mouth, listen « pal » you aint cool, just stupid! and this isnt just for this guy, yall should wear a mask ffs, no it doesnt make you unable to breath!"
"I've been following that sub religiously for months, and was even on it this morning, and suddenly it's private. I looked around other meta subs to try and find an explanation, but nothing. Anyone know what the reason is and if it's permanent or just some temporary maintenance for some changes to work out?EDIT: same deal with /r/covid19 and /r/covid19_support. Clearly something is up..."
"This girl and I have been messaging each other for a few months now but we still haven’t met in person because of Covid. We’re both in college taking online classes, I don’t currently work but she works in retail in-person. She got the first dose of the Moderna vaccine and I got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, so we will both be immunized 2 weeks after the second dose at the same time. (Our family members we live with are also vaccinated). What can we do since we’re both vaccinated when we can finally meet in person for dates and such? Can we hold hands? Cuddle? Drive in the same car with the windows up without masks? Can we kiss? Keep in mind she goes out in public often because of her job. Please let me know, I want to be safe for me, her, our families, and in general."
"Pre-pandemic I used to be able to do so much. I would get up at 6am, go to classes from 8am until 4pm, run errands, get home around 7 or 8pm, make dinner, clean, do homework, etc. all in a day's time. Now I can barely even run 1 errand before going to work. Anyone else feeling like this? I used to be able to do so much in a day and now my energy levels are just wiped out after even 1 minimal task.I've never had covid, though I have been an essential worker throughout this entire pandemic, so maybe it has something to do with that?"
"I had to get this off my chest because I just attended my grandma’s funeral today and still see anti-mask, “COVID hoax” posts all over social media.This. Shouldn’t. Have. Happened. Like. This."
"She was feeling unwell after symptoms from the first COVID-19 vaccine so she went to see (unnamed) doctor.  I looked him up online and he's a board certified physician in Internal Medicine who practices in Mesa, AZ.My mother told me that he is:* Discouraging her from receiving her second dose of the vaccine, moreover that * The COVID vaccine is a money-making scheme* That it's full of poisons* That it's untested* That even the social distancing guidelines' 6 foot rules are nonsense.Does anyone know if a doctor should be saying these things?  I am thinking about filing a complaint but I'm not totally sure if I have grounds to file a complaint since I'm not the party that saw the physician.  My mother is gullible and she believes him, so she would be unwilling to file a complaint against him.Edit: Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would attract every anti-vax nutcase on reddit with this post.  Don't waste your time, after reading your ridiculous uninformed anti-vax ramblings I've been printing them out and using them as toilet paper."
"Logan Ezra Smith, 20, who worked in the store where a gunman went on a shooting rampage in Boulder stayed in the store to hide his 69 year old coworker and stayed with her while the gunman returned to within 10 feet of them and helped others escape out of the store said ""My belief is she's older than me, she's my elder, so I must protect her.""This is what a person with character does."
"So I’ll try and make this short. Today my job is having a meeting for everyone returning to work (sometime in April I believe) and I don’t know what I’m going to do. The reason why I can’t see returning to work being safe is because I worked at a very popular and often packed restaurant on the Las Vegas strip in Nevada, precovid this was not an issue and even something I took pride in but with covid still a big problem I have some serious concerns. For one, I am a caretaker for my disabled mother who suffers from Lupus, for those of you who don’t know why that matters Lupus is an autoimmune disease and pretty much not only makes her immune system useless in fighting off viruses but also causes her immune system to attack itself. I’ve seen, more than once I should add, a common cold develop into pneumonia for her which caused her to be hospitalized for days at a time. The norovirus almost killed her once, I kept a log for her condition at the time (brought it with us in the ambulance that had to be called) and the doctors literally told me I saved her life because it allowed them to more quickly figure out what was wrong with her.Now a big issue with this is obviously if she gets covid it could very well lead to her death and because of that my brother and I have stayed home for the past year. Another big issue though is that I don’t own a car so I used to take Ubers and Lyfts to and from work and with the amount of money I was making it was totally viable and manageable but again because of covid that places me on a different car with a different driver with different personal hygiene and opinions on the pandemic every time I need to go into work and come home from work.These two issues coupled with the fact that the covid vaccine will not prevent me from transmitting the virus to her, and her doctors not being sure if getting the current covid vaccine is safe for her makes for a really difficult dilemma to navigate. My employer has told me if I refuse to return to work they will have to report that to the unemployment office as a rejection of employment which of course would then lead to me losing my unemployment benefits which have been the only way we have survived the last year and luckily been able to avoid eviction. Well that and the moratoriums however it would seem that now both will be coming to an end.I’m looking for advice as to what to do here, I have a bit of money saved that I can use on my rent to buy me maybe a month or two and my brother can probably add to that to help extend it even further but that also leaves us with little to no funds for anything else the house may need. My only plan atm is maybe to try and find a job I can do from home once my unemployment is axed by my employer. If anyone else has any ideas I would be very happy to hear them, any and all advice is welcome. Thank you. TL;DR: My job is reopening, my mom is high risk, covid is still out there and even with the vaccine it won’t keep me from giving her the virus. The vaccine may not be safe for my mother to receive her self due to having lupus (this comes from her doctors with a bit of concern from myself I must admit). Don’t own a car so if I do choose to go back I’d have to take Ubers which still pose a huge risk to my moms health. If I don’t go back my unemployment will most certainly be axed. I don’t know what to do."
"I live in a country were the Chinese vaccine (Sinopharm) is used. My grandma, who is almost 81, has recieved both doses, with the second dose being more than a month ago. However, she got an antibody test done today and found that she barely has any antibodies, almost as if she has not even gotten the vaccine, and was told by her doctor that she is still at risk the same way she was before her vaccination (there has been some talk about this vaccine not being as effective in older people). My whole family is obviously worried and unsure what to do. The obvious solution would be getting vaccinated again, but with a different vaccine? In my country, the Russian Sputnik vaccine and the Pfizer vaccine are available. However, I am not sure whether it is advisable to get vaccinated twice. I have tried to look this up online, and have not been able to find anything on it. I know people on here aren’t doctors, but just wanted to know whether anyone has heard/read anything about getting vaccinated twice or is in a similar situation."
"&amp;#x200B;EDIT II: i have passed the 48 hours so now i just have to sit, wait and see if any symptoms start to show? i feel perfectly fine rn, i just do not wan to give it to my dad if i do have it....edit: went into a TINY TINY bathroom at the doctors about 30 minutes after a covid positive patient was in there coughing (found out he was positive after i saw the doctor) and considering there was no more toilet paper as i was reaching for kleenex in my bag my mask fell off for about 30 seconds)i really cannot sleep right now, it's 4h23 in the morning where i ami was in contact 36hours ago ( i have severe asthma )i had a couple of  muscle pains in the day but idk if that's just because i had to quarantine myself on a shitty ass bed last night (can't sleep rn) or am noticing it now about to turn 30? i feel like i am going crazy because i don't know if it's psychological or real, i feel kind of foggy..and my entire family (cousins/gma/uncles/aunts included) didn't take it seriously either, during quarantine last year i actually went into a deep anxiety/depression because they kept dining every night like nothing was going on while my cousin was still inviting friends for dinner.they still came over to dinner while they knew i came in direct contact and my 90 year old grandma still comes over every night. this past year even she would get mad at me ever day if i didn't kiss her hello.... i have been so careful and i'm the only one who might've caught it...where i am there are no more beds in the hospitals so i have no idea how i am going to get through this at home,really don't want to to spend two weeks in a hospital bed but my dad's 65 and just now starting to have major asthma attacks.but ya mainly the first question... just had to let the rest outp.s. my cat will not stop meowing at my door, she sleeps with me every night and if i am sick WILL NOT leave my side, wtf do i do? sleep with the window open?&amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;"
Is anyone still struggling with this during this pandemic?
"This may not be the right subreddit. If that's the case, I apologize in advance.    I'm having problems convincing my 78-yr-old mother to get vaccinated. She claims she hasn't been given shots in her life. She's going through early-onset dementia, so I know some of what she says is just her not ""connecting the dots"". I told her that's simply not true. I don't know whether this would help sway her to get the vaccine, but is there some way to get immunization records for parents? I know she'd go along with it, but reading CDC's website, it doesn't appear US-based residents have a central database where these records exist. Also, if anyone has any wording for why someone should get vaccinated, not in a mean way, it'd help. I did mention it's not just about her, etc etc., but she's just not getting it. Thank you all in advance."
"So about a week ago my fiance and I got the first dose of the Pfizer covid vaccine (Yay!). We both had pretty usual side effects, arm pain and a little dizziness. However, it's been about a week and while my fiance's arm is back to 100%, my arm pain has not subsided. I can't use my arm to lift anything without pain and weakness, and even moving causes pain to run down my arm. At what point do I start to worry? Had anyone had this happen?"
"Okay so I just need to vent. I’m suffering and don’t even have the words to express it. So if anyone else is experiencing this, please try to describe it. So I ended up with Covid within the first week they announced it being in the USA. For the past year, I went through phases of no scent or taste, to taste (no scent.)Apparently it’s a sign I’m in recovery. But goodness freaking sakes. I keep asking god why!? I’ve lost 40 lbs. Meat tasted rotten. Then I couldn’t taste it. Now I have this taste that lingers in the back of my throat and in everything, it appears. Coffee, meat, everything. It’s almost like inhaling sweet perfume, getting it caught in your airways, swallowing a bit of it, and then realizing it’s actually a rancid spoiled fruit/meat taste. Imagine tasting oxygen, and it’s rotten and mildly sweet. IM GOING FKN CRAZY. You’d think brushing your teeth would help, but nope, it’s repulsive and extremely sweet and cold. I can’t take it. I can’t. Please find a fix to this. How would u describe the odor and taste that’s there 24/7 now. If I could go back to no taste or smell I would. I’m actually crying rn. You’d think a McDonald cheeseburger would be delicious, who knows what’s really in them. God."
"Maybe I’m crazy but we are coming around a year of this craziness and it has been so overwhelming. At first it was cancelled plans and some feelings of being bummed but now that I reflect on my interactions in the world, I worry it has evolved a little. Maybe just a year of more isolation that I would have ever hoped for?This week I had to go to the DMV which is never super fun to begin with. This woman was sort of close to me and she has her mask below her nose and was obsessively sniffling like she had a cold. I got called back and was like great, I’m done with this but later I ran into the woman again when she pulled down her mask to sneeze in my direction.In my day to day life a year ago, no one would ever upset me by having to move on with their lives while being sick. Now I can’t help but feel angry that people aren’t being considerate with one another. Feeling exhausted at the lack of education, the polarization, the isolation. How do people cope?"
"Posting because I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing metallic tastes as a result of the vaccine that hasn't gone away yet.Some background:I got my 1st vaccine shot (Pfizer) in late Feb and 2 weeks or so after I could have sworn the outside of my lips tasted slightly metallic like they would be if they were chapped.  Then it went away after a day or so.  Second shot was a week and a half ago and a few days ago, basically the inside of my mouth tastes very metallic.I don't have other symptoms that Dr. Google would say would indicate that I have liver or kidney disease and my gums are not red or bleeding, however I've seen search results come back for people who have been recently vaccinated or have had Covid having metallic taste.The only other thing to add is that I did have a pretty upset stomach between the first and second dose that lasted about a week.  (The type where you get a really bad cramp the first day, and then the next several it's like a gnawing sensation) - It went away with time and probiotics/yogurt and bland foods but now I am wondering if the taste is a result of me somehow catching Covid shortly after my first dose (and that the stomach issues were because of Covid), or maybe I possibly have/had GERD which also apparently can cause metallic taste.  I'm on my second week of taking Prilosec but the metallic taste is still kind of hanging around.It's frustrating that there could be so many reasons but again this started after my recent vaccine.  I took a rapid test yesterday and it came back negative.  I suppose I could get an antigen test next to see if I am recovering from an actual Covid infection.  So many damn variables at play that it causes me anxiety.  Guess what else causes a metallic taste in your mouth?  Anxiety.  Sigh.  At this point I also sometimes wonder if it is psychosomatic and I'm simply focusing on it too much.So again, if anyone else has had vaccine-related metallic taste in their mouth, I'd love to compare your experience for peace of mind.  (Of course if this goes on much longer, I'll get check out by a doctor.)"
"So basically I maintain taking a monthly test because I have people who are at risk to covid. I just received a call from my latest test that was thankfully negative. After that call they called again and a lady was telling me that “I am doing this wrong. I am being compulsive and they won’t test me anymore” I have never in my life had a medical professional talk to me this way telling me I’m compulsive and obsessive (her own words). She said just don’t go out there is no reason to test you further. People get covid from going anywhere: restaurants, grocery shopping, and other essential trips. I don’t understand this type of behavior. This was my spot and they are suppose to give me my second dose of the vaccine in two weeks. Super unprofessional."
"15 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson one-dose COVID-19 vaccines were ruined in a production mistake at a Maryland plant subcontracted to manufacture the vaccine.  Further production at the Maryland plant will be delayed.  The incident does not affect Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines already shipped to states.  But throws into question whether Johnson &amp; Johnson will be able to meet its goal of 100 million doses by  June.  The company barely hit its goal of 20 million doses by the end of March.  The White House is advising states to expect fluctuations in the supply of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  With three companies producing COVID-19 vaccines, government officials assert that Johnson &amp; Johnson delays won't delay the goal of widely-available vaccines by May.  However, the delays may still set back vaccination rates moving into late Spring.[https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/johnson-johnson-vaccine-15-million-ruined-478776](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/johnson-johnson-vaccine-15-million-ruined-478776)"

"Hello, on March 30th, my roommate and I both got the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. A few days later, my roommate informed me that he can no longer smell or taste. We even tried taking a shot of alcohol to see and he couldn't taste anything. From what I know and have read, the CDC has said that loss of taste and smell are not normal post-vaccination symptoms- only things like mild fever, sore arm, etc., but the CDC website said that loss of taste/smell could be a sign of covid or another infection. (This is the page I am citing [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/post-vaccine-considerations-healthcare-personnel.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/post-vaccine-considerations-healthcare-personnel.html))Another important thing is we both work together in a very busy, in-person, customer service position where we are interacting with many people in an hour. With that, my roommate called in saying he was experiencing symptoms and they told him to stay home. I too stayed home as a precaution as I hadn't received guidance from our HR department or anything. Come the next day, my manager tells me that I am required to come in, saying my roommate is only experiencing post-vaccination symptoms. In trying to relay why I was hesitant, I was immediately shut down and told if I don't come in, it would be considered a no-call, no-show.My question: Should I still be quarantining as well, or should I have gone in without my roommate being tested, even though I believe it is not just post-vaccination symptoms?"
"I received my first dose of Moderna on March 30th and read that after two weeks it could have an 80% efficacy rate. Does that mean after two weeks of the first dose you are pretty well protected against covid and serious illness? (Not that I’m not going to get the second dose or change my precautions, just trying to find out for some peace of mind with all the covid restrictions being lifted.) I’m finding a lot of articles of Pfizer but most articles I’ve read only mention that 80% number for Moderna without much more information."
"So almost 2 months ago now I began feeling symptoms of COVID, tested positive and felt like absolute hell for almost two weeks. Only started getting my smell back in the last week, still not fully there, taste is still off somewhat. But besides that haven’t experienced any lingering symptoms of COVID.Yesterday I started feeling an itch in my throat, and some congestion. Woke up this morning and I’m full on sick. Feels more like a cold though. Super congested, sinus pressure, headache, fatigue.Has anyone else gotten sick shortly after COVID? I’m sure it’s unrelated but it still makes me think.. there’s still so much we are learning about this virus, and I’m aware of people experiencing symptoms reappearing months later. But this just feel so much different. Either way it sucks. Just wondering if anyone else experienced something similar. Thanks!"
"I don't understand why people are so bothered about opinions. Last time i checked, Reddit is an opinion/advice/suggestion based forum.

If you don't like what a person is saying, feel free to keep scrolling. Had to block 2 idiots from my profile. I will not tolerate disrespect or name calling because I felt free to rant about my frustration regarding covid. With that being said. I hope that everyone has a great day and be SAFE in whatever you do!!!"
"Hey guys I just tested positive for covid yesterday however I’m fairly sure my exposure happened last Friday so I’m about 8-10 days into COVID. My symptoms have been very mild mostly just a cough, runny nose, but the nausea has been ridiculous. Monday through Friday I was very nauseous but I had periods where I was able to eat a little bit. But yesterday and today I have had no appetite.I know I’m hungry because I have ate less than 1000 calories per day in the last 10 days (because of the nausea) but I don’t feel hunger. My stomach doesn’t growl, it doesn’t even feel empty. When I try to eat food has no taste (I lost taste and smell 2 days ago) and my stomach feels full. It’s concerning bc I feel like the majority of my symptoms now are coming from not eating. At this point the cough, sore throat and runny nose have subsided. But I feel extremely dizzy, lightheaded, weak, and tired. How long will this last and how do I help my appetite increase? For once I actually want to eat but it feels physically impossible."
"Hi!! My mom is vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine. She got her second dose on 3/23. But then was exposed to Covid-19 on 3/25 and found out she tested positive on 4/1. She is showing no symptoms! Between that time, my dad and I were close to her.My dad is vaccinated. I am not.She has been quarantining in her room since she found out she is positive. My question is how likely is it that I test positive for Covid as well? Can you still give off the virus if you are vaccinated and asymptomatic? I feel great so far!! So my fingers are crossed. I’m getting tested tomorrow!!EDIT: I tested negative!! My dad tested negative as well. Go get your vaccines everyone! :)"
"I had my first shot - Pfizer vaccine - a week ago. Four days after I had the shot, I had a doctor's appt and had blood drawn.

"I got sent home last April because quarantine shut down my call center. I officially quit in September. Covid got so bad that my roommate decided it would be easier to just stay home without a job than to get my at risk roommates and friends sick. So I stayed home. I left the house 20ish times. I'm crying because now I'm finally getting to leave to get the vaccine. I'm so excited to meet up with my friends across town to do private Korean style karaoke. I haven't seen them in a year. I'm excited to have Christmas in may with my dad because we haven't seen each other in a year. I know I can't just start going out and partying. I was never really that way anyway. But I want a job so bad. I want my life back. I want to have a proper sleep schedual. And walk my roommates dog to the park without 30 who don't have masks on, then fear I'm going to get covid and spread it. I want to get on a bus and go downtown for some duck fries. I pretended for a year I was fine. I'm not fine. I cry every night when everyone goes to bed. I can't keep to a sleep schedual so the days I have class stay up 24 hours so I don't miss it. Then I can't finish my homework on time. I'm tired. I'm so tired."

"*Hope this is ok to post here, apologies in advance as I'm sure questions similar to this have been asked a million times* On February 2nd, 2020 my family all came down with a bad sickness. We were staying in Cocoa Beach, Florida at the time and had been there for about a month. The sickness seemed a bit different than other cold/flus we had had in the past and mostly consisted of a bad cough, sore throat, fatigue, and chest pain that persisted for almost 2 weeks. We were also really confused by the fact that none of us could taste anything for 2+ weeks. Ever since, we all have experienced something similar to what people describe as the ""COVID brain fog"" so we are starting to wonder if the sickness was COVID. Do our symptoms sound like COVID? Is there any proof that COVID was in the US that early on? I know they had originally said it wasn't but I've heard so many different things over the past year that I wasn't sure. Thanks in advance for any thoughts or opinions!"

"Asymptomatic positive retestSo I (25, f) am a healthcare worker from nyc. I received the first Pfizer vaccine in January, the second in February. I work in a nursing home and we do get the occasional positive patient here. In the beginning of March I tested positive for covid and I had to stay home for 2 weeks. I had absolutely no symptoms, however. I didn’t have any close contacts who were positive, so its likely that I picked it up at work. Now it’s the beginning of April and I tested positive AGAIN. I’ve had about 6 or 7 negative tests in between by the way. Another 2 weeks of quarantine is required. I feel absolutely fine, I have no symptoms at all at the moment. I did have some heart burn on Sunday and some upper abdominal pain (felt like gas) on Monday, maybe that’s related, maybe not. Of course I am very fortunate to not have any symptoms. Luckily, I was able to use the state covid fund for my previous quarantine. I have a few days left over that I can use from that fund, as well as a ton of vacation and sick days from my job. I do know other people who tested positive after receiving the vaccine, and all of them were asymptomatic. I guess I can attribute this to the effectiveness of the vaccine.Has anything like this happened to anyone else here?"

"I was going to post this in my local forums, but I didn't want to accidentally start a situation with antivaxxers or  start some kind of other debate. Here looks like a good place to ask.I plan on getting vaccinated at some point, and no one can talk me out of it. This is not a question of efficacy or science vs BS, this is a question about ethics.So a bit of background:The country I live in has had a horrible vaccine rollout. Absolutely awful. As a result, we have a limited number of doses, and we're prioritizing at-risk populations.I live in the most densely populated city in my country. As of a couple of days ago, they've begun opening up the vaccinations to any adult over 18, in what they designate as 'hot spots'. I live in a 'hot spot'.I'm under 30 and by all accounts pretty healthy. I've been privileged enough to have stable housing and to have the ability to work from home for the duration  of the pandemic. And I know that vaccination won't suddenly make it so that I can see my family/friends again. My partner, who I live with, also doesn't have to go anywhere to work, so we're both at home and safe, aside from a weekly grocery trip.Here's my quandary:With vaccines being in such limited supply where I am, I truly believe that frontline workers, obviously healthcare folks, anyone in retail, food-service, factory/construction workers, basically anyone that needs to come into contact with other humans should be prioritized. Statistically where I live, workplace breakouts are responsible for so much of the spread, and those people deserve to be safe.I also know that the more people who are vaccinated overall means generally better things. And while my risk is low, I can still catch it on those weekly grocery trips.I feel like getting vaccinated now would steal doses from the people that really need them. But I also want to contribute to the overall lowering of the risk of serious illness/spread, and take potential pressure off of the overwhelmed hospital system in my area if I was to contract covid.With all that being said... Should I get vaccinated now/ASAP? Or should I wait until more people have gotten it so that I'm not depriving a cashier or frontline worker of their chance to get vaccinated? I'm really torn. Any help is appreciated."

"I was sick the past week, not sure if it was COVID but I definitely did lose a significant amount of smell. What I've heard was people lost smell and taste - I had my taste the whole time. I know COVID affects the smell receptors directly, rather than just plugging the nose or sinuses, and my sinuses seem plugged so I'm still suspicious as to whether it was COVID - but I can't recall ever having this much reduction in my sense of smell while sick. Strong smells I could still smell very faintly the whole time, but it seemed like I couldn't quite perceive the full smell, just the very ""edge"" of it, if that makes sense. Has anyone who has tested positive experienced a similar thing? My sense of smell seems to slowly be creeping back to normal, just a tiny improvement every day. Is this what I would expect with COVID? Thanks."

"I have big issues with how governments are providing information.Let me be clear vaccines are NOT COMPLETELY UNSAFE, and **people over 65 years old should get one**. Basic risk calculations/estimations. However for young people, those under 30, it seems, especially depending on the vaccine, to be a higher risk to take the vaccine than potentially getting severe Covid-19.Keep in mind I'm far from looking at US data only, and I have mostly looked at European data.Now the problem I have is that vaccines are supposed to be the solution and answer. With them being extremely rushed and many governments giving the companies responsible indemnities or liability waivers, it's just dangerous. They should stop trying to force everyone and give people a free choice. While also informing them objectively regarding the (potential) risks and put the relative risks in perspective.**They should start basing their fucking decisions on facts and science and not political BS.**Vaccines do not prevent you from spreading it but might reduce your infectionous (reduction viral load), from initial reports the decrease does look to exist but seems rather small. Seeing how most countries used CT values of 35 for the PCR-test, it then doesn't make sense if average 25ct for non vaccinated adults decreases to a 27 CT to then say people aren't infectionous. [the proof is here, after vaccination you can't transmit the virus anymore (title, big news outlet)](https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/het-bewijs-is-er-nu-na-vaccinatie-kun-je-het-coronavirus-niet-meer-overdragen~a7cadeb1/)   [preprint study suggesting reduced viral after vaccination](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01316-7) (suggesting because preprint).That AstraZeneca is a bigger risk for **YOUNG** people (under 30) in Europe and my country can already be proven.

(I can show this for the Netherlands at least, I have the calculations and sources)This blog has a good write-up of the problems with how the study of Pfizer was done and how the data was presented, [blog](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/).Just for those who don't know Israel uses mostly Pfizer, also see [this news article.](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-honors-pfizer-chief-at-independence-day-ceremony/)[This website, swprs,](https://swprs.org/covid19-facts/) does a really good job at addressing a lot of the things around Covid-19 in a fairly objective way, better than many news websites who overhype everything.They also address the increased mortality in Israel:   https://swprs.org/israel-why-is-all-cause-mortality-increasing/   An update by them on safety:   https://swprs.org/vaccine-safety-update/.A lot of info I found around Jan 6, which I reformatted a bit, these line up with the health issues being seen in Israel. Keep in mind the explanation stress due to lockdowns and lack of preventive care are still options though. However how well the below matches is striking though:Several sources regarding **POTENTIAL** previously found issues in small trials (only phase I and II, before Pfizer I believe there had been no phase III mRNA trials or at most 1 or 2)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5906799/#!po=52.3973*Several different mRNA vaccines have now been tested from phase I to IIb clinical studies and have been shown to be safe and reasonably well tolerated (TABLES 2,​,3).3). However, recent human trials have demonstrated moderate and in rare cases severe injection site or systemic reactions for different mRNA platforms22,91. Potential safety concerns that are likely to be evaluated in future preclinical and clinical studies include local and systemic inflammation, the biodistribution and persistence of expressed immunogen, stimulation of auto-reactive antibodies and potential toxic effects of any non-native nucleotides and delivery system components. A possible concern could be that some mRNA-based vaccine platforms54,166* **induce potent type I interferon responses,** *which have been associated not only with* **inflammation** *but also potentially with* **autoimmunity** *167,168. Thus, identification of individuals at an increased risk of autoimmune reactions before mRNA vaccination may allow reasonable precautions to be taken. Another potential safety issue could derive from the presence of extracellular RNA during mRNA vaccination. Extracellular naked RNA has been shown to increase the permeability of tightly packed endothelial cells and may thus contribute to oedema169. Another study showed that extracellular RNA promoted blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation170. Safety will therefore need continued evaluation as different mRNA modalities and delivery systems are utilized for the first time in humans and are tested in larger patient populations.**While preclinical studies have generated great optimism about the prospects and advantages of mRNA-based vaccines, two recent clinical reports have led to more tempered expectations22,91. In both trials, immunogenicity was more modest in humans than was expected based on animal models, a phenomenon also observed with DNA-based vaccines171, and the* **side effects were not trivial**. *We caution that these trials represent only two variations of mRNA vaccine platforms, and there may be substantial differences when the expression and immunostimulatory profiles of the vaccine are changed. Further research is needed to determine how different animal species respond to mRNA vaccine components and inflammatory signals and which pathways of immune signalling are most effective in humans.*.https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/110/7/2457/103661/Extracellular-RNA-mediates-endothelial-cell*Cell injury leads to exposure of intracellular material and is associated with increased permeability of vessels in the vicinity of the damage. Here, we demonstrate that natural extracellular RNA as well as artificial RNA (poly-I:C), or single-stranded RNA but not DNA,* **significantly increased the permeability across brain microvascular endothelial cells** *in vitro and in vivo.*.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1851071/?report=reader*Here, we present in vivo and in vitro evidence that different forms of eukaryotic and prokaryotic RNA serve as* **promoters of blood coagulation**.   Basically a potential risk for blood clots, possibly in your brain or heart, which matches with some of the increased health problems seen in Israel while having vaccinated a majority of their populace..https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.immunol.23.021704.115843?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmedMore about interferon poyential issues ^"
"I wasn't sure where else to go, I am just feeling so incredibly defeated. I'm in Ontario, we are in yet another stay at home order.

Now they are threatening to pull people over on the road to ask why we aren't at home. The only thing I ever do is go for a coffee through the drive through, I have multiple masks with me and sanitizer and I go straight there and then straight home. I know it's silly but it's the only thing getting me out of bed and now they are making me scared to even do that . . .  It is so hard to get up in the morning. I never feel like there is a point to leaving my bed, I'm not gonna see anyone so what does it matter? I was supposed to be moving in to an apartment with my boyfriend at the start of May but the stay at home order was extended so I cant do that.

Got the JJ vaccine back when it first became available to us so least 7 weeks ago or longer.  Now I find out someone I was just in a car with last week tested positive for Covid. I’m going tomorrow to get tested but what are my chances of having it? I know there isn’t a perfect answer but should I be extremely worried? Thanks
"Hey everyone, I just want to share my experience with Covid-19 with you.I got infected the 5 of April. I most likely got it from the plane I was on while traveling. I was in quarantine for 12 days and I was basically asymptomathic. Now I'm a 19 year old guy and I'm a very active person. I used to do swimming and gym daily before getting covid. I had a reletively tame quarantine. Apart from mild coughing and a runny nose I was completely fine. Altough I'm active and young I just want to remind people how this virus isn't just the same as the flu. I've been tested negative 3 days ago and I feel like my lungs aren't working 100%. I now experience shortness of breath from walks I would be fine with and I experienced very bad shortness of breath and fatigue while doing swimming practice. All these effects might just be my body recovering but as someone that had covid very mildly I believe covid leaves long-term effects on the human body. Not everyone would have long-term effects but the fact that I'm young and active yet I still experienced a change in my overall health made me realise how serious this virus really is. I'm really glad vaccines were found relatively early. I couldn't imagine my parents experiencing what I did as they would probably have it way worse.Sorry if this post seems a little weird but I just wanted to share with people how even young and healthy people can get affected by the virus."
Hi all. Just looking for some advise. I've had both my two jabs of astra zenca.  After getting home from work today I've been told by the UK app that I need to isolate for 10 days as I may have been in close proximity to someone with covid. I've only been to work. No where else. I drive to and from work. Always wear a mask and have had both of my jabs. Would I be stupid to ignore the app and carry on as normal? I can't afford to skip work and I don't have any symptoms. I know it sounds stupid but to me the notification sounds a little silly in my eyes.
"I was in therapy for severe germophobia and health anxiety for 2 years before COVID even hit, so feeling sick is not a temporary inconvenience for me.  I know if the first dose makes me sick I'll be hard pressed to go back for the second one.  Meaning I probably won't.  I wanted the J&amp;J shot but couldn't get it before it was ""paused"" so now I have to choose between the ones with worse side effects and am terrified.  This isn't normal anxiety, it's a diagnosed mental illness.  It borders on panic.  I live in the middle of nowhere and if side effects like high fever, tachycardia or high blood pressure happen in the middle of the night like they have with some people, I won't have a ride to the hospital (40 miles away) and will have to call an ambulance which is embarrassing in a small town like mine.  **I'm a daily user of high doses of Tylenol with codeine, a stimulant &amp; TONS of supplements and other medications.  How can I know they won't have dangerous interactions with the vaccine?**This isn't an ""ask your doctor"" situation.  I'm not getting it from my doctor but a group of random nurses who come to town administering it out of a health van thing.  Yeah.  I know I need to get the shot so I can go on with my life but I can't help thinking it's not a one-size-fits-all situation.  There are people who take all manner of meds and even recreational drugs, have health conditions, etc.  Is this safe for us/them?  (I know not to take Tylenol before the shot to avoid suppressing my immune response but will be resuming it afterward to avoid withdrawal from my codeine.  Just don't want some crazy interaction to kill me like it might have killed [this] (https://wset.com/news/coronavirus/utah-woman-39-dies-4-days-after-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-autopsy-ordered-kassidi-kurill) woman).

Hi I’m a 17 year old male and Covid lock downs and fear really messed me up I lost over 30 pounds and suffering this year really badly . My doctors want me to get the Covid vaccine so I will feel safer getting out of my house and back into the real world. I’ve been on the fence about getting it for a while. All of my family has been vaccinated and I am the only one not besides my little brother. I’m really scared about a allergic reaction to the vaccine and possible side effects. I’ve gotten my flu shot every year and never had a reaction to it or any side effects beside a sore arm. I don’t have any allergies besides a avocados making my lips itch. I took many other vaccines all the ones a kid gets including HPV vaccines this one just worries me. Is there any way to know if I will be allergic to the vaccine and my possible side effects based on past experiences
"I am scared to take the Vaccine, my uni is offering but we still don't know what the long term effects are. I want to keep everyone around me safe but not at the cost of my own safety (it sounds selfish but idk) . I heard that it can mess with the reproductive system, I'm only a 20F but I do think that one day I want to have kids, I don't want this to the reason I cant have kids or the reason something happens to me and doctors wont admit that the vaccine would've been the reason. I guess this just all scares me. Pfizer is new technology and anything new is scary. I guess you never know till you try."
I’m 17 turning 18 in a couple of months. Can I book an appointment in advance so that when I turn 18 I can get it immediately? My parents are anti-vax and won’t give parental consent.
"Hi all, Been browsing this subreddit for a few days leading up to my vaccination (1st dose). Just letting y’all know that I just received the Pfizer, and am waiting in the 15min recommended area by the pharmacy. The shot was literally senseless and quick, I didn’t feel any prick or poke or anything. I completely understand people being hesitant and skeptical and anxious, however I have been following the data for some time (I am a psychologist), and the overall benefit is well worth the potential risks. Read people’s stories on here, you don’t want COVID. Regardless if you have the perspective of “you have a 99.99% of living”, people who contracted and lived MAY live now with some sort of chronic illness. Please be mindful of that. I wish you all well and I will follow up tonight (it’s 1:15 PST)."

" Hello, Friends all Nation! I would like to concern you all regarding the devastating corona case in **INDIA**. Every day lakh’s of people are being affected by corona. Thousand’s of people are dying daily in every region of our country. Each day we break our record of patients and death tolls. Doctors, Politicians, the Army, industrialists, Entrepreneurs, Religious institutes, NGO’s and many sections of our societies are trying their best to help each other in these devastating conditions. Due to record cases, hospitals are treating patients in full capacity. Tones of oxygen are used daily for treatment in these hospitals. Lots of medicine are used for the treatment of patients daily. Due to this many of the regions in our country have an acute shortage of oxygen and essential medicine. Our Pharma Industries are trying their best by working at full capacity to deal with this shortage of medicine and oxygen. Some countries are already helping us by providing oxygen tanks, airlifting mobile oxygen plants, providing us doses of vaccines as much as they can. But after all these efforts are being made the conditions are getting worse day by day. People are traumatizing with fear! Families are losing their loved ones, Doctors are losing their will. Fear is arising among all of us. But all we have is hope!I urge all the people who read this to please provide the people of India, **Hope!****Hope to live again, to be with our loved ones again, to be healthy again, to live with freedom again, and to be United AGAIN!**Your one small wish to concern about this situation for us can ignite the ray of hope again among ourselves to overcome our fear now.Thank’s for reading this Sir/Madam."
"Hi all, I had the second dose of Pfizer yesterday and have been crippled in bed all day due in large part to a headache. I has covid in Dec and had a very strange headache then and again after my first dose. But the headache I have today is different and I wonder if it should be cause for concern. I have taken two ES Tylenol and slept, but the uncomfortable pain in my neck and a tension in my forehead persist. I have been tossing and turning for hours it is so uncomfortable.Thoughts?"
"Does this sound normal, or even right for the second dose of covid? I’ve got a high fever, headaches, muscle cramps, constipated, both my eyes are bloodshot, and my appetite is decreasing.I got the shot on Monday, and these started yesterday with probably the worst fever and headache combo I’ve had in a long time. Let alone, the muscle cramps that stopped me from sleeping. Is this a reaction to the vaccine, or might I be positive?EDIT: Got tested, I don’t have COVID! But I still feel in the dumps, so I probably got some other bug."
Hey so I am 17 and I got the pfizer shot and I had a pretty bad reaction the night of just getting a fever and chills but then 2 days later I wake up and there’s a huge rash on my face !?!??? Did anything like this happen to someone
"It is a long story but i'll start where i can. (typing this out is going to be a bitch.) So the start of 2020. Obviously this was something everyone can relate to. March 3rd. This is before any covid news hit the u.s. I was at work when i got a call from my husband, my dad had fallen down the stairs of my childhood home. I knew something was wrong, my dad had never fallen out of nowhere before, he was only 56. I called my dad, and he sounded exhausted, so tired he could barely speak. Luckily, i only worked 3 minutes away EXACTLY.. I asked him if he needed medical attention and he said he wasnt sure. I quickly hung up with my dad and darted to my truck across the parkinlot. As i am running, i CALL 911 AND tell them to meet me there.  Now REWIND 24 HOURS, when i left for work that morning, there is a set of rail road tracks that run through our whole neighborhood. This train was sitting behind my house. FOR WEEKS!    i had called multiple times to move this railcar. Its illegal to park where they did. They have an entire train yard 50 yards away.      So the day everything happened, they had finally moved this train, they blocked the neighboring street, tracks THEY NEVER USE! THEY BLOCKED THE ROAD. AFTER I GOT THE CALL ABOUT MY DAD I RUSH DOWN MY USUAL STREET AND ITS BLOCKED BY A TRAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 30 PLUS YEARS.      i go around. Im 2 minutes off. I run  up the stairs and unlock the doors. Ems never followed me in. I came back to the door and yelled WHT ARE YOU FUCKING WAITIN FOR!??!    I RUN UP THE STAIRS  looking at the blood from my father as i run to the second story, he had dragged himself back up the stairs..     I see him, laying face down on his bed. He isnt moving. He isnt breathing. I shake him. I yell for him to wake up. DAD ! DAAAD! DAD WAKE UP! HE DOESNT MOVE. (I have medical experience) i notice he soiled himself, and then i knew. I was literally 2 minutes too late. Honestly TOLEDO ems. Y'ALL NEED SOME WORK! SO. My dad, hes gone. Then came his father. I moved from ohio to tn. Cared for my grandfather for a few months til he eventually succumbed to kidney failure without dialisys.  It's messed up. I still havnt found a way to deal with my loss.  I not only lost my father and grandfather before covid. I had to Deal with my loss in quarantine. But just before this, i lost both of my grandmothers, my closest uncle, my husbands father.... and i just cant help but wonder. Was it covid before covid started???   It was already here but we had no warnings. No one had traveled in my family. We lost 8 people im 3 months BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT DID ANYTHING!!! AM I WORNG??? Ok editing, to make paragraphs... cuz thats a thing."
"If i test negative but still am showing alot of symptoms, Do i still quarantine? I seen that my test result page said at the bottom of the page to quarantine anyway for 7 days after first symptoms. Can I get an excused note form the health dept for work for this?The health dept is closed and idk what to do about work tonight."
" I work in a deli and customers come right up to the counter with their masks on their chins. I tell them ""I think your mask slipped"" and they have always pulled them up. The other day my manager pulled me aside and told me that if she catches me doing it again I will be written up. There is a lady with a f\*\*\*\*\*g zipper mask that I have never seen closed. Is this legal. We don't even have a plexiglass shield like checkout has. It just feels like they care more about the customer than their loyal employees."
I’m 20(f) years old and have my COVID vaccine coming up. I’m having second thoughts as I read more about the long term effects it could have. Could someone please tell me more about the positives/ negatives about the vaccine if you know? Thanks!

"I know our bodies have a warm temperature, what like 96.7 ° or something? How come our heated bodies don’t increase the likelihood of the vaccine decaying?Or am I thinking that this decay is an instant thing, and that in reality it decays over a number of hours when not in a very cold storage place?"

"It ia true. That seems pretty low right? Look at it this way, World War 2 was the bloodiest conflict in human history. America sent over 16,000,000 soldiers to fight. Over 600,000 died. A truly terrible loss. That percent is one third of the chance of dying from Covid. Yep! You are 3 times more likely to be killed by Covid than Grampa was of getting killed by the Axis.Now, if you went to fight in Germany, would you wear a helmet? Keep in mind, helmet would not stop a bullet. But it might stop shrapnel or debris or a glancing shot.So...why not wear a mask?"
Hello all I am a 17 year old male going in for my first Pfizer does tomorrow morning. I’m really getting worked up over a possible allergic reaction to the vaccine. I have received 20+ shots in my lifetime including the optional HPV shots and my flu shot every year. I do not Have any history of allergic reactions to anything and my whole family is vaccinated besides me. I want to get this vaccine so I could help other be safe and feel more comfortable getting back to normal.  I have severe anxiety and ocd so this thought of having an allergic reaction is really getting to me. Is there anyway to know if I could have an allergic reaction?
"The whole point of a vaccine is to trigger the immune system response so that memory T cells are ready and your body has a more efficient response against future infection. So if you’ve had full-blown covid and recovered, what’s the point of getting the vaccine?Does the answer change based on pathogen (for example, does a chickenpox vaccine help with shingles if you’ve already had chickenpox)?"
I live in Northern Alaska and tested positive yesterday. My symptoms have ranged from mild to severe and when they get severe I take a hot shower/bath then use nyquil to knock myself out.

"Don't get me wrong I'm all for it but seeing people post negative things about it left and right, all over social media everywhere I look is making me super nervous. I was so hyped and now I'm just nervous. People have also told me I don't need it anyways since I had covid once already. What's the truth?"
My penis size has grown by a few millimeters since taking the vaccine. Has this happened to anyone else?
"Hi all, I posted in a comment in my other post about this but it wasnt my main question, so I figured I'd ask to see if anyone had some answers or ideas. I did ask my doctor about this, but they said there wasn't enough research. I've looked it up myself but could not find a clear unbiased answer.Basically my question is, would by baby have covid antibodies? Or be affected at all? I had an extremely mild case, like I'm talking I didnt know I had it til they had to test me since I wanted to get induced. All I had was a headache. I'm not sure if that matters, but anyways. I caught it November 26 2020 (I was able to contact trace), and had my baby December 10 2020. (My due date was november 30 2020). If anyone has information about covid in pregnant women, especially so far along I'd be interested in hearing it. TIA :)"
Had covid mid January. Lost my taste and smell. Never really came back. I can taste and smell but everything seemed a bit muted. Last Sunday night I was smelling cigarettes constantly. No one in my home smokes. It’s day 5 now. Still constantly smelling cigarettes. Anyone else have this? No one has answers. It’s scary and frustrating.
"First time poster on this sub.. Am I the only one that's super anxious about getting my covid jab? My doctors surgery called me today, they had a cancellation, but I was toy shopping with my daughter so couldn't go. They offered me another date. I asked which one I would be getting, and they told me Astrazeneca. Before I knew it, I said no thanks and hung up! I'm not sure what came over me. Both my parents and many other people I know have had it. Some had a few symptoms after, others has none. All were fine.Then I started researching, and if I had a choice, would personally choose the Pfizer.I don't get to choose obviously, so have to take what's given. I'm willing to have what's given, because I want to keep my family/other people and myself safe, and I love holidays! But I don't really want it. I suppose no one does. I just feel a bit scared, am I being irrational?Sorry for the long post. I'm hormonal and had a couple of beers! Please be nice.BTW, I have now booked by jab for 2 weeks time."
A. As soon as you are vaccinated.B. As soon as 80% of the population is vaccinated.C. As soon as the experts say it is safe.D. Not until Covid is 100% eradicated.
"INDIA is suffering from a covid crisis unlike any other. Covid cases constantly increasing and death continuing to rise. With the guarantee many cases and death are unreported.Sporting events seem to be still going (IPL).Religious festivals still occurring.No space in hospitals to treat patients, no space in crematoriums. Not enough people helping in cremations. People dying and waiting days for their loved ones to be taken and cremated, all whilst the dead body dead from covid are in their homes. No proper PPE equipment for the charities and volunteers who are running around to help their fellow countryman to the hospital or the dead to the crematorium. When these people contract covid who is going to do their work?Hospital set on fire yesterday patients who needed care burnt alive.INDIA a manufacturer for COVID vaccination, yet these are sold to the rest of the world for pennies at the expense of its own citizens.India has many multi millionaires and billionaires.India has many superstars who are worshiped like gods. India has Bollywood which has been watched by every Indian. India has politicians who speak or act like they are gods and are treated like ones too.What are they doing to help.........I have never posted on reddit but used reddit for a long time. Today was the first time I have ever felt the need to post."
I was horribly sick. All the COVID symptoms. Went to emergency. They tested me for all the known virus at the time all came back negative. A few days later I was fine. I don’t believe this wuhan story. Or at least the timing of it. I think it was spreading for months before the Chinese government said anything.
"My friend had the vaccine 14 hours ago and was trying to sleep. He was awaken from deep sleep because his body just won't stop shaking. Even if he breathes on his hand, his body sees it as cold wind and starts shaking. He's stood nest to a room heater now, but it's quite warm outside. Please tell me if this is serious and worth a 911 call."
"Please note: I am in no way an antivaxxer. I have been vaccinated, I encourage others to do the same, and I believe in science. With that disclaimer out of the way, my mom got her first dose of the covid vaccine back in February and about a week later developed what they believe is GBS (Guillan Barre Syndrome). She is in a lot of pain, very at risk, no one can give her answers, she is not allowed to get the 2nd vaccine, and they cannot be sure of the efficacy of the first vaccine due to the treatments she received in the hospital. I am seeking info on any studies/trials that are quantifying vaccine efficacy. So far all her antibodies tests have come back negative. I read some stuff on T cells and the UK's t-spot discovery kit. We are in the US. If anyone has any leads, I would be eternally grateful."

 There is news that [Novavax’s](https://www.wiserxcard.com/novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-may-be-authorized-next/) maybe the next COVID emergency vaccine to be authorized in the USA. The company plans to file the paperwork in the coming weeks and can beat out other coming vaccinations.
"So I just tested positive for covid. I've been going through alot lately between my son dying and everything that entails. When I told my boss I tested positive for covid and I have it, he literally said I don't care, it's just a cold. You can still work, just wear your mask and cover your mouth. I was taken aback from this. Like he literally doesn't care about this pandemic. Let alone me because I had to ask for bereavement time. Mind you I work for FedEx.I literally just don't care anymore, is there someone I can call to get his ass in trouble because this is not something to be messing around with. Please advise."
"I've observed that quite a few perfectly healthy youngish (40's) people have been getting it bad and dying. These people were careful (masks, social distancing as much as possible, etc), still got infected and ended up dying in matter of days / weeks. I wonder if some people have some sort of a fatal combination of genes, as it were?"
"So my brother's wife is anti covid vax for facebook fake news reasons. My brother has decided to also not get the stab to avoid arguments with his wife. Once his state opens up and removes the mask requirements and people start going out again, Covid will spread like wildfire, correct? My understanding is vaxx'd people will still ""catch"" covid but just not get sick meaning we can still spread it. So the risk for people who aren't vaxx'd is going to go up like crazy?I'm just looking to confirm so I know what i'm talking about when i try to convince him to get the stab without her knowing. All my googling just leads to stories about anti vaxxers.Thanks all."
"Want to say thank you to every front line worker on here.. This past year has been more than stressful and seeing first hand how strong, dedicated and genuinely loving you all are has taught me a lot. I hope you get all of the love and support from your family and friends that you deserve, after every day of this battle against the pandemic and opioid crisis. It’s a lot to handle in many professions right now and you have been coming to work day after day to support your communities. Thank you."
I was diagnosed with covid on April 26th it’s now over two weeks with no smell or taste. For those who have lost smell/taste when did it return ?
"Hey everyone,I'm 24 years old and I've been suffering from erectile dysfunction since 14 months - ever since I got sick with Covid-19 and I don't know what to do about it.Ever since March of 2020, I've been experiencing phases of no erections and sexual desire, and some erections but no desire to jerk off. Three months ago, I checked with my doctor and he ran several blood tests to monitor blood cell counts and hormones. Everything that was tested for was within normal range - even testosterone. Based on that, he couldn't help me other than suggesting to do self-therapy everyday which is nice expression for jerking off daily. I've been also keeping track of my diet and started working out regularly but haven't seen any improvement.I'm incredibly frustrated about not being able to date knowing that sex wouldn't really be an option. Does anyone know how to fix this or at least improve it? Is there another post on here I'm not aware of with a similar issue? Also, is anyone facing similar problems right now? If so, do you experience exactly the same things or does it differ from what I described?Thank you all for your help!"
Title says it all basically. I’d love to hear from anyone who is also in this unique position. My mom is very anti-vax therefore I have 0 vaccines at 25. I however do not share her views and would really like to get the covid vaccine to protect myself and others. But I’m scared. I have no clue if I’m allergic to vaccines in some form or what kind of reaction I might have. I also have been dealing with crippling panic attacks recently and I’m scared if I get the shot I’ll convince myself something went wrong and have a horrible panic attack even if nothing is wrong. What do I do? Anyone in a similar position?My mom just tested positive for covid and she’s in her 60’s and is overweight and so I’m terrified for her safety (she lives in a different state). I want to go take care of her but as I’m unvaccinated it’s unwise.I just don’t know what to do. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.Thanks
"I am a sixteen year old male who lives with two vaccinated parents. They have asked me several times if I wanted to get vaccinated. The most recent time I said yes.The thing is, I’m not necessarily feeling a need for myself to get this vaccine. I eat healthy, workout and run, and sleep well. Not once during this pandemic did I feel sickly. My parents have said that there are other strains of covid that have the potential and more likelier to injure/ kill younger people. Also that it helps everyone get back to normal if we all get vaccinated.I feel like the only thing really motivating me to get this vaccine is fear of being judged by the people who believe everyone should get it. I’m not against vaccinations, I just know that I could potentially induce covid symptoms by getting this vaccine whilst never even feeling it throughout the pandemic. I do not see a reason as to why I need to get this. Plus the long term effects of this new vaccine are not known. Why even take a chance when I’m a healthy person who takes care of themselves? I’m worried I will get this vaccine just because of fearing the reactions of saying no."
My mother’s mom passed away to covid yesterday. She’s traveling to India from the US very soon. Is it safe for her ? She’s fully vaccinated with both doses of Pfizer.
"Here's a video for context:https://www.webmd.com/vaccines/covid-19-vaccine/video/video-covid-mrna-vaccineBasically, the mrna vaccines makes the muscle cells make spike proteins. But won't the immune system kill those cells? If so, WHAT ABOUT MUH MUSCLE GAINS?"
"Is there anyone here who took the Oxford Astrazenica vaccine as a first jab and went for another vaccine for the second jab or are planning to do this? In France, around half a million people are in this situatuon. What are the pros and cons of doing this?"
"I’ve heard so much completely contradictory information on this. I’ve heard that it’s 95% effective at preventing transmission of the virus, but I’ve also heard that it in no way prevents transmission, but it decreases the severity of the symptoms."
I'm feeling really weak after my recovery and i feel like my body is shaking. Like even while typing this my hands are shaking. Is anyone else facing anything similar?
" Federal government wants you to report it!"" There is no person in the country who can be charged for the COVID vaccine,""Medical providers are not allowed to bill consumers for the COVID vaccine.""Providers sign a contract with the government that they will not charge consumers a dime.

"Hey everyone, I just have a question:I received one dose of the Pfizer vaccine (more than 2 weeks ago), but my brother (who I’ve had prolonged close contact with) tested positive today. I went for testing, but with a fever of 103.8, I don’t think I need to receive my results to know I caught it too.Does the Pfizer vaccine alleviate some symptoms of the virus after catching it? I’m mildly delirious right now, so I’m having a hard time finding info about it online. Any response is appreciated :)"
"My parents and I received AstraZeneca in March. I had severe symptoms like headache, cold and a really bad backache. However my parents just felt tired for a day and that was it. We've started noticing some sleeping difficulties ever since we received the jab, like waking up several times in the middle of the night or trouble falling asleep. I'm not worried about myself because I have a messed up sleep schedule. My parents on the other hand have a fixed sleep routine and get 8 hours of sleep every night. Because of sleep issues they feel tired throughout the day when that wasn't the case before. I can't seem to think of any other reason as to why they're having this. They haven't been under stress lately and there routine hasn't changed at all. I'm not against vaccines I'm a medical student myself but I'm a little concerned for my parents."
Someone in my family got the covid vaccination for school and they are coming home soon. I have 1 year old and 6 month old should I be concerned?
"So my story here is purely anecdotal, and if it is proven to be an outlier I will gladly accept it.A weird mix of people in my life have chosen not to get the vaccine, and I don't know what to think of it. I consider myself to have a fairly diverse group of friends from various economic, racial, religious, and political backgrounds. I work two jobs: one with many politically conservative, fairly educated folks (mostly white and under 45) who have all gotten the vaccine or are at least one shot in. My other job is more diverse, not as educated but still some levels of education, who have not gotten their vaccines and aren't in any rush. My friends from college, a diverse and educated group, are about 50-50 with vaccines. Then I have some friends from where I grew up, who generally fit the WWC category, who have gotten the vaccine as much as my friends from college have. The only trend that breaks through the last two groups is age, everyone is south of 40. A lot of older people in my life, mostly people above 40, have been pretty quick about getting the vaccine and almost everyone I know over the age of 40 has gotten it. I always sort of figured younger people would be more gung ho about the vaccine. I will fully admit I read the news far more than all my friends and a lot of coworkers from my 2nd job, so I could very well live in a bubble. I'd love some information on if my situation is a abnormality or something that is happening with people. I also do have my vaccine."
I’m 13 and I really want to get vaccinated. I have a bad immune system so i’m already high risk. my moms never been anti vax but she won’t let me get the vaccine. I’m pretty sure i can’t go back to school next year without it.What do i do?
Just kinda ranting here... It’s been 8 months. I didn’t care until March when EVERYTHING started tasting and smelling like rotting meat. Eating is such a chore and I’ve definitely eaten a lot less than usual since this happened. Doctors said there’s nothing they can do :(

"I had covid back in November, should I wear a mask?"
"The news no longer says anything about how many folks have covid and only focuses on the vaccine. How do we know it is safe to return to normal? I work in an office and I am dreading having to go back to the hassel of getting dressed up sitting in traffic, small talk around the water cooler etc etc. Is this pandemic really over? People sure are acting like it is."
does scale of a super spreading event matter in covid propagation? does scale of that event or participants number matter in the speed of spreading ?
"just overheard my boss making fun of a coworker for not feeling great and asking for a tylenol after getting his second dose of Pfizer from Monday. he said ""oh my god you're still on that? are you serious? you are *really* milking this. you're like my 12 year old son - 'wahhh i can't go to school wahhh'"" -- normally his humor walks a fine line between sarcastic funny and asshole but i'm curious where on the line y'all think this is?"
"Universities, such as Cornell University, are removing online options and are requiring students to attend class in-person. Realistically, this can only be accomplished by also mandating that students receive the vaccine - which is what they are doing. The 'choice' Cornell is giving students is to take the vaccine or dropout.Since Cornell is making the decision, then at the very least they should also be responsible for any complications that may occur. If the vaccine is safe, as they tell us that it is, then this costs Cornell nothing. Having the mandating party be responsible would help make sure that such decisions are being made carefully and truly in everyone's best interest.[Petition](http://chng.it/8QSZjw5C) for Cornell to take responsibility."
"May 11: ""But even with this powerful [vaccine] tool, while we continue to have community transmission, we must also maintain public health measures we know will prevent the spread of this virus mask, hand hygiene, and physical distancing."" - Walensky testimony to Congress.May 13: ""Anyone who is fully vaccinated can participate in indoor and outdoor activities, large or small, without wearing a mask or physical distancing,"" Walensky said."
"This was a complete misstep by the CDC.  Maskwearing should be done by all or none.  The idea that if you are vaccinated you dont have to wear a mask basically means anyone who doesnt want to wear a mask will claim they are vaccinated.  AND if you are vaccinated and still want to wear a mask, you are advertising to the world you are not vaccinated."

Cancelled tonight's show.  Rest of crew tested negative.  He's asymptomatic.
My friend just told me that they were tested positive. I've been staying with them for the past two weeks. I had a covid pcr test few days ago and it was negative. I also just had the Pfizer first dose this morning.Would I still infect others and would the vaccine still work on me?
"I have seen recently that a lot of animals that were adopted over the shut down and covid restrictions are now being returned as thing open up and return back to normalIs there a way to verify this? Is there way to do something about this? Is is a social issue we can address?We've all been through so much this year. At least all these animals finding homes was a beautiful note. My mom's animal shelter adopted out hundreds of animals (Teton animal adoption center) some have started (4) to come back for ""misc reasons"". We are a small community that stays long term and most leave season to season so 4 is hard to guage.The angry, vindictive side of me wants to know, can we do something about this? Publicly shame them some way? I just wants to know that this isn't true."
Or will they send me home?
"got my first shot of moderna a month ago. not too bad. my arm hurt for about a day or two and it felt like i had a slight head cold for a few hours and then i was totally fine. yesterday morning, i got the second dose and holy mother of god this is the worst. i have never been in so much physical pain in my life. i can barely even dress or go to the bathroom, it is excruciating and i have been in tears a couple times since. i am not a melodramatic person when it comes to being sick. im good at just powering through it and getting on with my life. but i cant. do. almost anything. i know body aches tend to come with the vaccine but oh my gosh, nothing prepared me for this. when will it stop? other than taking ibuprofen, is there anything else i can do? has anyone else been like this?"
"I thought if you are vaccinated  you can just still get covid, you just won’t get severe symptoms. So, wouldn’t lifting the mask mandate put the people who can’t get vaccinated (no appointment yet or health issues that mean they can be vaccinated) at risk? I thought masks are supposed to stop you from giving it to someone else."
So yesterday I went to a family gathering and I forgot my mask at home and my mom insisted I go in I didn’t want to but I went in for about 3 hours then left fast foward to about 20 minutes ago I woke up with a pounding headache my sense of taste and smell has vanished and it feels a little bit harder to breathe and Have mild body aches. Does anyone have any tips for at home treatments or what you did to fight it off I have a vaccine appointment tomorrow but I think I’m gonna have to have a rapid test done today before I get itUpdate: I got a rapid test done and got the results back the same day I do not have COVID I’m also feeling normal I don’t think I had i was probably just freaking out after being around so many people
"For context, I am 29 weeks pregnant with my son and my entire family are covid conspiracy theorists. I had attended my sisters 18th birthday dinner at my moms house this weekend where my mom then decided to admit to me that she was “pretty sure” she had contracted Covid. I informed her right then and there that if she truly thought she had covid, I shouldn’t be there and that I was mad she was so selfish as to risk not only my health but my unborn son and fiancé and our 5 year old as well. She “reassured” me that covid isn’t even real and I had nothing to worry about. Queue my entire family berating me for believing in covid and being called “retarded” for considering the vaccine for the rest of the evening. Covid is scientifically proven to be harder on pregnant women and unborn babies. What I’m not understanding is why would they stick me in that situation? I am currently trying to think of a way to put my whole family in a group chat and tell them that we can’t be around them for our own safety and their blatant ignorance and that they can expect the rules to stay the same once baby is born as well. I guess I just need somebody to tell me I’m not being crazy. I need help!"
"How come when the cdc recommended that people wear two cloth masks for maximum safety the clowns and woke group jumped on it right away and it was trust the science.Now when its released that mask wearing can be way more relaxed people are freaking out and not obeying it, but now no longer trust the science."
"How can it be that they recorded zero deaths and they have declining cases (hospitalizations too?) and they are “completely open”. I bit pro or anti mask, lockdown, etc. I want to understand the rationale or science behind why that’s happeningEdit:  Just realize I wrote I bit instead of I’m not"
"I’ve heard some people with covid get extremely sick, and some people don’t even know they are sick. With the vaccines some feel awful, and some don’t feel anything."
"Most of these symptoms are listed as potential side effects by the vaccine manufacturers however…It is very hard to find any information about these other types of symptoms and potential side effects as they relate to covid vaccines and because of that it is very hard for people who are experiencing these potential side effects to know what they should or shouldn’t do about it. How long should they wait while still having symptoms before contacting a doctor?What degree of these types of symptoms should they tolerate before contacting a doctor?Can they do anything at home to relieve the symptoms?How common is it to have symptoms like this after being vaccinated?Should they get a covid test if they have these symptoms after being vaccinated in order to rule that out? (In my non expert opinion I would think so). Should they report their symptoms to the vaccine manufacturer and the vaccine adverse reaction data base? Should their doctor?Pain at the injection site, fatigue, and fever are the much more common side effects of the vaccines and there is of course much more info about those symptoms, and what you should or shouldn’t do about them, online.   So I have assembled a list of links to personal accounts found on Reddit. I will add links to personal accounts found outside of reddit as well if I eve find any. Some of these accounts seem very credible, others are interesting for the pre-existing conditions the people had, and some are interesting because of the way the in which the people managed their symptoms at home or sought treatment.   Covid itself can cause all of these symptoms as well. Its important to note that people can and do catch covid shortly before and after they receive their vaccination so unless you are tested for covid while having these symptoms it is impossible to rule out covid as being their cause.   There is at least one study that finds that gastrointestinal symptoms signal a more severe case of covid (for those whose symptoms are due to covid and not the vaccine).  https://www.contagionlive.com/view/gastrointestinal-symptoms-could-signal-severity-of-covid-19It is of course impossible to get covid from the mrna vaccines like Pfizer and moderna and possible but unlikely with attenuated virus vaccines. Some accounts of gastrointestinal issues / apparent side effects have also been associated blood clots for both mrna and non mrna vaccines and for both the vaccines reported to rarely cause blood clots in the news like the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca and for vaccines never reported to cause blood clots in the news like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Here is a report of a man who had to have part of his intestines surgically removed die to am intestinal blood clot after being vaccinated. https://greatgameindia.com/intestine-blood-clot-vaccine/In the personal accounts linked to below one person reports a blood clot that caused a kidney infarction. Another study posited that the covid vaccine destroys peoples good gut bacteria / micro flaura and suggested these symptoms should be treated with probiotics and prebiotics.  If this turns out to be true I would guess that severe cases might benefit from being treated with a fecal transplant (thats when you stick someone else’s poop up your but to steal some of their good intestinal microbes). https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n149/rr-20Some people just seem to get over these symptoms while others have had to receive medical interventions.https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nent9k/pfizer_2nd_shot_kidney_infarction_due_to_arterial/https://www.reddit.com/r/CaronavirusMemes/comments/n1b8wa/is_diarrhea_a_side_effect_of_covid_vaccine/https://www.reddit.com/r/GotTheVaccine/comments/nf1icq/moderna_2nd_dose_ongoing_effects/https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/n5hifr/be_careful_with_the_covid_vaccine/https://www.reddit.com/r/mastocytosis/comments/mw4kxe/my_experience_with_the_covid_vaccine/https://www.reddit.com/r/CovidVaccinated/comments/nd1jib/moderna_shot_stage_2/https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/n5utzh/vaccine_side_effects/https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/mmwz4m/evidence_that_covid_vaccine_causes_ibs_flareups/https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/miemzw/anyone_have_gi_problems_a_month_after_covid_and_a/https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/l0ge82/interesting_reaction_to_the_covid_vaccine/If you can find any more relevant personal accounts on Reddit or elsewhere or find any other relevant information online please link to those sources in a comment.*******************Update:I want to add that if your symptoms become extremely painful or don’t at least start to get better after a few days to go get medical helpMost peoples symptoms do go away with time. In general things that might help include benadryl, ibuprofen and aspirin for OTC meds. You should also probably avoid eating meat, unfermented dairy, anything with added sugar, lots of simple carbs (because they are quickly converted to sugars), and processed foods in general. Also avoid coffee and alcohol.  Avoid caffeine except for maybe some green or white teas. Try to eat onions and garlic and no sugar added yogurt and kefir as well as miso soup (they are probiotic), and prebiotic foods (whole vegetables and fruits that contain lots of natural fiber). Grocery stores and health food stores now sell packaged prebiotic snacks and supplements. Of course you should probably try taking some probiotic supplements.  Avoid sodas or any sugary or carbonated drinks and that includes most juices. Make sure to stay hydrated.  While having indigestion and bloating probably best to avoid beans and lentils as well as vegetables that contain lots of oxalic acid like spinach and broccoli and Brussels sprouts and almonds.And finally I want to encourage you to go get vaccinated if you aren’t. The covid virus causes all of the symptoms that covid vaccines do and more and it causes them much more frequently and to a much higher degree. Out of billions of people a only handful of them will have a negative reaction to a vaccine that is so strong it kills or severely injures them. You have a better chance of winning the lottery than being one of these people. For everyone else any side effects from the vaccine will be much less severe then the symptoms you would have experienced with the virus.  And while the damage the virus does to your body can COMMONLY last months or years or even the rest of your life the side effects from the vaccine are are almost always temporary.And don’t think that you can just isolate yourself forever and reliably avoid the virus without a vaccine. This virus is 10 to 100 times more infectious than the common flu depending on whether it is the original virus or a variant. You should be of the mindset that choosing to NOT get vaccinated means that you are realistically choosing to get the virus at some point in the future. I know which one one I would rather take my chances with but ultimately you have to make your own decision."
"Let me clearly state that I AM NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER. I DO believe this virus is a real thing. I am not here to bash on people but to get answers to this question. Again, I’m not trying to oppose the view of the vaccine, I’m just genuinely curious about it’s purpose/intention with everyone getting it.If the point of the vaccine is to make you basically not die from it/be badly affected by it, then why are they pushing it so much? And why are people becoming so divisive about it?If you can still get it (like it’s not a shield to the virus, but more of a shield to your immune system/shielding you from possible death) even having had the vaccine, then why is there such bad talk about folks who don’t get the vaccine? Because like the vaccine isn’t made to repel the virus right? Like you can still get it, yeah? It’s just that you wouldn’t get it as bad as it could potentially be? I’m open to all answers &amp; conversations, but I’m not open to dickfaces who are trying to push something without an explanation."
"Hi Folks! Just wanted opinion of any doctors or whoever knows about the topic. My mother has a condition called [ITP](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura/symptoms-causes/syc-20352325#:~:text=Immune%20thrombocytopenia%20(ITP)%20is%20a,cells%20that%20help%20blood%20clot.) . In this condition platelets in the blood are very reduced, leading to low immunity. Should she get vaccinated for Covid in this condition? The doctors have a mixed opinion about this..TIA"
"There will always be a percentage of the population that has not been vaccinated, for either personal or health-related reasons. I understand that the current guidance says only fully vaccinated may go maskless - when do you think EVERYONE can take off their mask, regardless of vaccination status?"
"I got the pfizer vaccine and I seem to have side effects that nobody else has. The side effects aren’t bad, I just lose my taste and smell for a few days. My taste and smell comes back for another few days, but then I lose them again for a few days. Has anyone else had these side effects? I can’t find any information about people having these side effects online. I recently went to the dentist and asked my dentist about it, and he said everything in my mouth seems perfectly fine. I may see a doctor about this, but I wanted to see if anyone else possibly has these symptoms. I’m just worried that this side effect won’t go away as I know that there is a small percentage of people who had Covid who have not regained their taste or smell thus far."
"It is the new flu, we will have to get a new shot each year and people will always die from it each year."
"Not sure if this is a proper subreddit, maybe there's another one, if so please point me to it. But I have a question and hope others can help me find the right answer. I am not an against vaccinations, but I am hesitant to take the covid-19 vaccination. A couple of reasons that really make me feel uncomfortable/not confident. One reason has to do with the whole movement and push to get it, I've always been sceptical of anything that someone else says you must have, idk I am just weird like that. But constant commercials and all the hype really turns me the other way. Also the fact that it seems rushed, FDA still hasn't approved it and we really don't know long term side effects. I think if you need it, take it... If you're worried that covid will kill you then take it. I had it already last year around January, she had flu like symptoms like no other, I was fine. We both have anti bodies and don't want to take the vaccine.. but feel like people are forcing us to take it."
"I work in retail. We have, in the past, required masks for all customers, but now that the CDC changed their guidelines, a lot of people aren't wearing one anymore. My work place still requires customers to wear a mask. I don't like confronting people about it, so I just never say anything. But the head honcho told me that I have to kick out people who refuse to wear a mask. I really REALLY don't feel comfortable with this because, again, the confrontation thing. I'm just wondering what to do in these situations..."
Has anyone here been tested positive for covid after being fully vaccinated? I’ve been fully vaccinated for 5 weeks (doesn’t include 14 day period after second dose). I noticed a really bad headache Monday/Tuesday. Then congested and sneezing my head off Wednesday-Friday. Realized Friday I had no sense of smell. Got tested and it’s positive. I have no idea what to expect because breakthrough cases aren’t really documented
"I've been vacinated for a month. After the new guidelines for vacinated individuals I'm ready to go back to restaurants. I'm mainly only comfortable with outdoors right now. Just because I'm not used to being around a lot of people after socially distancing and staying home for a year. I received the Pfizer vaccine and I know the chance of me getting COVID and spreading it are very low.However, I just don't know the etiquette in restaurants now. Such as, do you wear a mask when not eating still? Especially when your waiter comes to your table?I know It's low for me to get them sick. However, the waiter and staff don't know I'm vacinated. I don't want to offend them. Anyone know the etiquette now a days? Please be kind!"
"My father in law has been on a vent for 2 weeks, in the hospital for 3 weeks. He has pre-existing lung conditions that aren't helping. His peep is at 12, and oxygen is on 100%. My mother in law has moved in with us for the time being for morale support. The 3 of us have good times and bad. Does anyone have any stories of people recovering from a vent that I can share with my mother in law to help her feel better? Any and all positive stories are greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!"
"Of course I would do it again if I had too but this second dose fucked me up. Got vaccine 1pm Friday (yesterday) and by 10pm I had major chills, low-grade fever, muscle pain, and fatigue. This morning I woke up after very restless sleeping and had an *extremely* severe migraine headache. I laid in bed and slept on and off until 5pm and the worst of rhe headache was over but still have a medium-bad headache, major fatigue, and a new symptom -- nausea. About an hour ago I puked up a bunch of bile (since I hadn't eaten in 24 hours). Puking made me feel mostly better briefly, but now back to headache and fatigue. My experience has been reminiscent of opiate withdrawal. I was not expecting this, and had formerly assumed most people who complained about second shot side-effects were exaggerating to get out work. Now I can understand. Hopefully I'll feel mostly better by tomorrow but my Saturday is unfortunately basically lost.Anyway, I just wanted to vent. As I said I would do this again in order to be fully vaccinated. It's not just about me not getting Covid, but also about not participating in spreading the virus and indirectly contributing to someone losing their life."
For some context i’m a 20 year old guy i take really good care of myself except for the fact i smoked cigarettes from 13 to 17 years old and now i smoke a vape. i’ve been horribly sick already for two weeks and i’ve had my first vaccine but all of a sudden i lost my smell and taste. i’m getting tested in couple hours but if i have covid i’m terrified. i really talked my shit about it too saying it seemed just like a cold from what my friends said but i smoke and i don’t know how to prepare if i do have it and i don’t really know how bad it actually is... I feel like my friends just BS and say that it wasn’t bad because another friend of mine (he smokes cigarettes currently) is in the hospital with it right now. i mean he is a recovering crystal meth and heroin addict so that might be it but i’m just freaking. i have horrible health anxiety and i can’t do hospitals
"So me and my wife are in separate boats here.She seems to have next to no faith in the Pfizer vaccine's efficacy and is as paranoid about COVID now as she was before being fully vaccinated, and while I absolutely agree on taking precautions and being careful even now that we're fully vaccinated, such as wearing a mask and keeping our distance where possible, I'm trying to convince her that we can't stay locked in the house and avoiding everyone for the rest of our lives.I personally have faith that the vaccine is at least mostly effective and that, despite not having a 100% success rate against COVID (what vaccine other than the Smallpox one really does?), it is effective enough to start venturing out to bars and other larger social gatherings.But I'd like to know the exact figures, whichever way they sway.Out of the 127,000,000 people in the US who have been vaccinated for COVID, how many people have gone on to catch it, and how many of those people have then died?  Sources for these figures is requested, of course."
"Hello, I’m looking for input. Any rude comments I won’t respond to, so don’t even bother. I am hesitant about the covid vaccine. My mother has a few autoimmune disorders that have been linked to vaccines. Doctors can’t say for sure this is what caused them, but it’s never been ruled out either. If there’s any chance this vaccine could trigger and auto immune disorder in myself, I do not want this vaccine. Has anyone ever heard this? Also on a separate note, how do we know the mRNA technology doesn’t have long term issues, when this is the first vaccine to actually use it? Does anyone have any links that breaks down exactly what’s in the vaccine? Any help would be appreciated. I don’t want to be hesitant, I just am."
Eventually people might join and I want everyone to be heard and not feel alone..
"Walking around outside, in the fresh air, with my mask on, others masked up, but I smell their perfume.  Doesn't that also mean that I am breathing their exhaled (potentially infected) air?"
"I would just like to know if anyone else is having this problem. I received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine a week ago. The first two days I felt really sick body aches headaches, fever and j just felt terrible. On the third day after I got the vaccine I felt great but that night ever single muscle hurts. It’s now been a week in having trouble waking all my muscles hurt and I don’t know what to do. I’ve been to my doctor and she ran a bunch of tests and can’t find anything but when it got really bad she told me to report to the emergency room so I did that. When I got there I asked if this could be a side effect of the vaccine and no one who even look at me after I asked that. They completely avoided me and didn’t even check me out they told me we don’t deal with this kind of thing in the emergency room. So has anyone else experienced this because idk what to do."
"last year in july, Google decided to extend the work at home option for most employees until the end of june ‘21... now all of the sudden most states are making drastic changes and planning to fully reopen by july. how precise of a guess was that?? How did google know ? or more importantly, why has nobody questioned the accuracy of that prediction until now?"
The theory that is being pushed the most is that this virus came from the transmission of an animal to a human. The closest coronavirus to COVID-19 was caught on a bat which was 94% similar. However I haven’t read about COVID 19 being spread among bats or pangolins (the most likely source of the virus).Has any experiment been successful in infecting bats/pangolins with COVID 19 ? Why aren’t more of these animals infected with COVID 19 given that is so infectious?Why a virus whose main hosts where animals not being successful among them but so effective with humans ?COVID19transmission is normal even to dogs and cats but not with its original hosts. Can somebody explain this to me ?

"Let me be clear that I’m NOT an anti-Vaxxer. I DO believe covid is a real thing, as my friend of 22 years old got it twice. (Luckily he only lost his smell temporarily)Anyways.Why are the folks who have been vaccinated, the most salty towards people who haven’t been vaccinated?Like dude, you got the vaccine, you’re supposed to be safe from it, why are you still bugging out at the people who haven’t had it? I know you don’t really care about my health. So what gives? Yes I know it’s a potentially deadly virus, but since when did everyone become so concerned with everyone else’s health? Go be this way towards cigarette smokers, they provide second hand smoke that can kill you, there’s like no difference. Remember the saying “my body, my choice”? This applies here as well."
I see so many articles coercing and telling others to coerce their neighbors and loved ones to get the covid -19 vaccine. I just want to say that I respect your personal choice and autonomy. Please don’t let someone coerce you into doing something that you feel uncomfortable doing. You do you!
"I currently have COVID and I'm quarantined, is it ok to drink a beer?"
"It kinda freaks me out.  I’m vaccinated, but when half the ppl at grocery store still masked up (including me) all I keep thinking is, the ppl that are suddenly comfortable to be all up close n personal, are the same ppl that refused to be vaccinated, and/or wasnt covid conscious, even when it was mandatory. Covid has LONG TERM EFFECTS. In fact, I think I had it in November 2019, when I had an “upper respiratory infection” that incapacitated me for 2mos, and ever since, ive gotten sick every 6wks. Dizzy, nauseous EXTREME CHRONIC FATIGUE (exhausted for all 14hrs I could force myself to stay awake), allergies that I’ve never had, constant cloudy head (REPEATED COVID TESTS,  but since they weren’t testing when I 1st got sick....Anyway, I was just wondering if there are any stores that I can shop at, that aren’t gonna make me feel like I gotta go back to sterilizing my grocery bags, n changing my clothes every time I leave the house, and—-blah blah blah"
"hi, so i got covid back in late october and i recovered after about a month. really my only symptom was the loss of taste of smell which only lasted three weeks. now that i’ve recovered n have been recovered for months, i’ve noticed my taste and smell have been.. altered ? things that i used to enjoy for example anything orange flavored, watermelon, and chicken taste and smell rotten to me. another thing is the breeze when i go outside, it always has a rotten smell. my question is, has anyone who’s had covid in the past experienced this? i know some folks haven’t recovered their sense of smell and taste, but has anyone else had their senses altered to where certain things they used to like before they caught covid now smell and taste rotten?"
"I am fully vaccinated. I'm pretty sure the CDC says it is safe for me to visit with my unvaccinated family members. However, there is still a small risk that I could catch and spread the virus.How do I really weigh this risk? What are ways I can reduce the risk? Worried more about my family than myself, but having to self-isolate if I caught COVID would still suck."
"I'm making this post to see where others are at with their longterm effects. I had COVID until early January, during which I lost my taste and smell for a week or so. For a couple months after that, everything went back to normal for the most part. However, the past few months I have been experiencing a foul taste and smell with certain things, and its getting progressively worse. One thing may taste normal last week, and now will ""taste like covid"" (dumb term I know, but thats how I simplify it). I've conducted a list of everything I've noticed is different, and I've been adding to it.This is my list of things that now taste/smell like the disgusting ""covid"" smell I've mentionedGatorade, lemonade, sprite, coke, dr pepper, car exhaust, fried chicken, lysol wipes, gasoline, mint tooth paste, charcoal tooth paste, cinnamon toast crunch, french toast, monster energy drink, cabinet wood, hot cheetos, any pasta, toner, dish soap, starbucks iced coffee drink, hand sanitizer, turkey bacon, nail polish, red potatoes, popcorn, pumpkin seeds"
"I got the covid test with the mouth and nasal swab, and ever since then I’ve had minimum 2 nose bleeds daily and constant headaches, I’m 16 and haven’t been allowed to attend school for 3 weeks now. Why Tf is my nose bleeding doctor said that there’s nothing he can do other than recommend me pain killers and nasal spray."
"Hello everyone,My dad transferred covid to me in January. Me, my sister and my dad had the same symptoms. After a while, my family got all their senses back where I still can't smell or taste like normal.Does it happen to any of you guys??!Thanks in advance."
"Someone has to explain this to me, because it sounds like total bullshit to me.  1.  If someone was going to put a mind control device in someone, why would they use an injectable vaccine?  Why not a tablet (pharmaceuticals and ""natural supplements"")?  Tablets are much bigger, it's a lot easier.  Who opens every single tablet or capsule they take?  Everyone in America takes tablets.  There's capsules with cameras in them to look at your intestines, vaccine needles are tiny.  It's a lot easier to make small cameras than microscopic ones.  2. Pharmaceutical companies want to make profits.  Why would they go with vaccines?  How many times in your life do you take a vaccine vs how many times do you take an antidepressant or a cholesterol tablets or whatever?  If you were after money, you'd want someone taking your product every day.  Also vaccines are unpopular - you'd be much better off going with vitamins.  3. If you want to sell something, you have to convince people they need it.  If COVID is some kind of fake advertising campaign for whatever reason, it's a pretty expensive fake.  Hundreds of countries, millions of paid actors, entire pretend hospitals.  Instead of that, you could just run more ads on the TV saying ""not happy all the time?  You could be depressed.  Ask your doctor about Thinknomore"" or whatever.  4. Plus - all these multinationals are interlinked.  Whoever owns Pfizer would have to own a few airlines and half a dozen hotel chains and about a squillion other things.  Why would they want people to stop flying and travelling and spending?  There is no way they are making enough money from the vaccines to cover the other stuff.   5. If there's a conspiracy, how come we hear so much about it?  It is all over Facebook - how come no-one stops that?  A lot of you use your phones.  There's a thing on the iphone called ""find my phone"" where you can look for your phone using another device - that shows it's constantly broadcasting it's location.  It has a front facing camera and a lot of them you have to sign in with your face, so it knows who you are.  You literally type the anti-vaccination stuff into it as it watches you and sends your location out to whereverthefuck.  Why don't all these anti-vaccine posts disappear, along with the people who make them?  And if they do, how come there's still so many?  6. And the masks.  If there was an organisation that wanted to track you, don't you think they'd want you to take off the masks?  Don't you think they'd want you to gather at rallies and stuff?  How does taking off a mask help you not be surveilled?    7. What the fuck is it with all the ""conspiracy"" posts about supporting the police and military?  If there was a sinister conglomerate looking at a new world order, they would enforce obedience.  And you're all posting stuff that's ""take off your masks, gather in large groups in front of our cameras waving placards that say what you believe, support the police and military, obey the law if you don't want to get shot.""    8. Has all of this stuff made your country or your community or your family more united, or is it like the difference between the two sides of society is even further apart than before?  What would a hostile foreign power want?  Would they want your country united or divided?  Do you see a lot of rallies and division in China or Russia?  9. If you were a TV station or a newspaper or an ""influencer"" who wanted to enslave people, would you tell them you were an influencer and the voice of their masters and that they were slaves?  Or would you tell them that you were a lone brave voice, and everyone else was the mainstream media, not you, and that listening to you made them free?  10. Are you more in debt than your parents or grandparents were?  Is it easier to get a job?  Do you work shorter hours?  Do you have more job security?  Are you, as you read this, closer to being a billionaire or even millionaire than they were?  Is the weather better, is it easier to ""get off the grid"", do you worry less, is life simpler, are you happier, or even as happy?  Is it possible that you are being deliberately distracted from what's going on?"
"She was going to parties and is incapable of wearing a mask properly, she eats everyone food they brought too. I didnt know she was sick but she did, went around her when she coughed/sneezed, although I got up and left after that I think I still mustve breathe it in or something. Now my throat hurts.&amp;#x200B;Man I worked so hard. And I got serious pre-existing medical conditions. This sucks so bad."
"I am still wearing masks daily, even though some places are allowing people to come into their place of business without masks if they have been vaccinated. I'm fully vaccinated but still prefer to wear a mask."
"Context: I got my first AstraZeneca jab at the beginning of May, just before the UK government changed advice that under-40s should not get AZ but should opt for Pfizer. I didn't suffer any adverse blood clotting or low platelet (VITT) side effects, caused by an adverse immune response to the viral vector technology, and acknowledge completely that these are extremely rare in the population. I have my 2nd AZ jab in mid-July.My question, however: Given that the 2nd vaccine dose cements the memory of the immune response of the first dose, and since my immune system responded as it should have, does this reduce further the statistical risk of me suffering a VITT reaction event from said 2nd dose? Not concerned, particularly, just curious. Any links to sources on the numbers would be greatly appreciated."
I had a mild case of covid at the start of April and now we're in June and still my weird heart rhythms and palpitations won't go away I saw a cardiologist he said it's probably post viral myocarditis and didn't give me any medication because he claims that it heals on it's own. I'm 17 years old and I'm scared for my life because of these skipped heart beats and such. I don't want die this early.
"Hey! As the title says. Every day, multiple times a day, in varying severity.  It has been two weeks and im fucking freaking out.  Its mostly on my limbs but sometimes on my face and neck now.  Its been affecting my performance this semester making me hardly able to function.  I have a doctors appointment today but im not sure what will come of it and will update.  I went to my allergy clinic two days ago and they said they didnt know what to tell me except keep using Pepcid, Benadryl, Cortizone cream, the usual.  Im super allergy prone.  Im just scared.  Im miserable.  Taking the medicine regularly would be fine except it all makes me fall asleep super quick making me unable to function every day.   What is wrong with me? *Is this happening to anyone else?  The whole hives thing?*  i just hope im not alone and want to hear if anyone has had a similar experience.  Im sorry if this statement wasn't well constructed ive hardly slept in 3 days.       ||      UPDATE: Hey all!  Thanks so much to everyone who responded! I finally got a little sleep in too.  So my doctor put me on Atarax, which from what i understand is just Zyrtec but way more intense (or at least they share a primary compound).   Said to only take it at night so it doesnt make me tired in the day, and also to cut the Pepcid and use hydrocortizone *with aloe* to help ease the irritarion. She also said she had no clue what VAERS was but was thankful i let her know, and said that though she isnt sure what the cause is, that this medicine should help.  Lets hope  :)"
"Genuinely interested as I can't seem to find an answer that is not heavily bias.So I was wondering, if covid19 is less likely to be transmitted by a vaccinated person, or make them sick, would it also be less likely that they'd be ""the cause"" of a new strain/mutation ?"
"let's say that i get my 1st box of colour pencils, and in 12 weeks i need to get another box of pencils. will these two boxes be the same or 2nd boxes will have less green pencils that will be replaved with more red shade pencils?i already had my 1st az vaccine. i know that i need to take my 2nd vaccine az. not other company. but are those two doses exactly the same?"

"Hey.Would someone be able to tell me if this will be permanent by now? 🤣 I'm not complaining. People went through with much worst symptoms. I'm just wondering if I should check it with a doctor or just wait ""a little"" more. Last time a read that if it won't come back after 6 months it will never come back but... Maybe a month ago, I read that, there is no one that would never recover taste and/or smell. And for me it is wird, because I have smell, not as good as before but it's fine. I can feel the basic tastes like salty, sweet, bitter, sour but I can't tell if I drink a coffee or just a hot sweet water. I'm not concerned if it won't get back, I can live with that.Is there anyone who has same ""side effects""? 🤔😊"
I lost my taste and smell when I had covid back in January. I have my taste and smell back but not completely and things taste and smell differently than before and it’s quite annoying. Has this happened to anyone else? Any tips to get my smell and taste back to “normal”?
"I got my second dose of the vaccine about a month ago. However, I am currently experiencing a lot of symptoms. I have a sore throat, shortness of breath, tight chest, congestion, and a fever.  Should I get tested?"
"I’m sure most wouldn’t question the reasoning behind honoring the fallen of D-Day, but many will question the death count and severity of COVID-19 even though more have fallen."
"I just went to my dentist and was surprised to see air filter units in each room. This is the very first time I've personally seen any business do this. She spent less than $800 and got a half dozen air filtration systems, one for each room. They filter down to the Covid size particles and has a UV light inside the unit. She found them on Amazon. I think the big mistake of this pandemic was to go with the fomite theory over the aerosol particles being the primary cause of infection. Most offices do not have windows to open and the ventilation systems in most office buildings are not clearing out the air in a room adequately, if at all."
"My partner was asked by the boss to look into ventilation standards and issues in relation to Covid transmission for the office space they use. After talking to the physical plant guy and actually reading the manual for the ventilation system in the building and many other sources of info, the conclusion was it would be extremely expensive and perhaps not physically possible to bring the building's ventilation system up to good Covid 19 safety levels. Their office is typical of many offices: no windows to open and ventilation systems that are decades old.Hello \_\_\_\_\_\_,I wanted to briefly update you about my follow-up conversation with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ today.He confirmed several facts about the current ventilation at the building, all of which present a concern for contamination due to aerosol transmission of covid-19.The system basically runs like this: The building lets in outside air by opening the dampers, with the level of opening determined by humidity et al. The opening level currently is at 25% but the dampers might be opened to 100% if relative humidity would allow that. We would never know how open the dampers are on any given day. The set point is determined by comfort, not public health needs.The system is an on demand mechanical system. This incoming air is filtered by the Merv 13 filter. The air is then distributed into the offices via ducts. From there, it is collected and and exhausted equal to the intake amount. The rest of the air-which at this point is considered dirty air-is recirculated, and redistributed into the offices. All of the above is determined by a confluence of temperature, pressure, relative humidity, and capacity of the system.Here are the most obvious issues in regards to using these offices at this time with a possible aerosol transmission:1.While the MERV 13 filter represents an upgrade, it is not rated to the filtration capacity for covid-19 virus. This filter rating of Merv 13 was evaluated for capacity going down to a particle size of 0.3 microns. It excels at filtration of larger particles that are also in the outside air such as allergens. At this level it filters out approximately 50%.The average size of corona is 0.125 micron-significantly smaller. The building's system cannot accommodate a higher level Merv filter that would be needed to do a filtration for viruses. The fit of higher quality filters is different, but also the system would not have the power to drive the air appropriately through a 'tighter' filter and bring up and maintain the pressure of the air to what would be needed. This means only a large retro fitting could accomplish this change.2. A mix of clean and dirty is an obvious problem, but it also points out that even if we were to have a strict mask rule on our side of the floor, we would still get the dirty exhaled air from the other side of the floor that is not ours. Overall though, this point also drives home why a rule allowing people to decide if they want to wear masks behind their closed doors would be a very bad idea as their shared air gets shared by all when re-circulated.3. Even a 100% opening of the dampers does not represent a 100% replacement of air in the offices. It represents a relative value depending how much air is let in per minute, or cfm. \_\_\_\_\_ has agreed to give me more info on this next week. But he agreed with my comment that it is far from turning the air over completely. For corona virus transmission reduction, fresh air ventilation is recommended at least 6 times per hour based on previous info I provided. It seems safe to say at this point, that the ventilation in the building is far from that. 4. The masks available to most people are a form of surgical mask. While they reduce corona transmission due to droplet infection if the person is sick, they are not faring so well for aerosol transmission of the smaller particles. As stated before, the size of the particles is very small. The smaller particles are of great concern as they move most easily into the lungs.To truly contain the aerosol particles which will travel the path of least resistance, one would have to upgrade the masks to N95 masks. The obvious issue with surgical masks for the health of the wearer is the leakage since these masks are not sealed or even fitted. The bigger the gaps of a mask the easier aerosol transmission, meaning these particles escape AND enter through the gaps. An N95 mask is rated for 95% catch of particles all the way down to a particle size of 0.1 micron. However, it is very difficult to talk through this mask on an ongoing basis. It is unclear at this time for how long even an N95 mask could keep this up in a contagious air situation. Ongoing talking would also raise the volume of particles expelled and inhaled through breathing.. I have also placed a phone call and left a message to speak with a representative of the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Engineers to possibly be able to confirm specifics regarding \_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Street.  They have several very technical publications addressing this issue as it has long been a concern for other illness such as the flu. The ASHRAE is a governing body issuing recommendations concerning ventilation in all form of buildings to deal with a virus transmission threat:Currently, the recommendations are:Clean to dirty air flow so people can theoretically function in the cleaner spaces.Filtration according to the threat.High outdoor air exchange rate.Disable demand controlled ventilation and open dampers to 100%.Bypass energy recovery ventilation that leak infectious exhaust air back into the outdoor air supply.The building is not able to accommodate any of these recommendations.I am awaiting to speak to \_\_\_\_\_ more re: the air flow diagram, as well as the air exchange rate. I believe one would have to rule out aerosol transmission for this illness, or at least have more information of the associated risk with aerosols for covid 19 to appropriately enable either usage of the building during this illness, or do an appropriate risk assessment."
"Covid vaccine has been created in record time. No vaccine before could ever be done so fast. It took years at minimum.  WHO said at start of pandemic, it will take at least 18 months at fastest.So I'm wondering if safety measures and steps were skipped to create it fast? It seems to be done in a haste.  Is that why they don't know how much longer than 6 months can it last?I'm also concerned that the hastily prepared vaccines may have long term side effects or complications that are unknown as of now.The speed of the vaccine is the reason I refuse to get vaccinated as of now. I want to wait and see what happens after an year."
"Husband officially got a positive covid test just under a week ago. He has been reallllllly struggling to breathe for 2-3 weeks now. His first test came back “inconclusive.” His O2 is always above 97% (when checked by myself and his doctors, as we’ve gone to the emergency room twice now). During these last few weeks, he’s used an inhaler, been prescribed steroids, antibiotics, muscle relaxers, and ibuprofen. They only thing that seems to help him is the inhaler, and that is short lived. We’ve been doing some breathing exercises. I was just wondering if anyone out there found things that helped themselves or loved ones who suffered from being out of breathe due to covid. He says it feels as though he is breathing through a straw, and no matter how deep a breathe it takes it doesn’t feel like enough."
"Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed four new cases of locally transmitted [COVID-19](https://www.connectedtoindia.com/singapore-reports-lowest-daily-number-of-covid-cases-in-three-months-9213.html) infection. Of these, one is in the community, linked to previous cases and has already been placed on quarantine."
"To all the doctors nurses and scientists last years involved with Covid, I want to thank you for all you have done. You have done a great job in your community. Keep up the great work."
"This was the place that two types of people commented.First  you had people that believed in science and took the advice of the scientific community and were concerned with preventing illnesses and deaths among others. They got vaccinated, encouraged others to get vaccinated and took all the step recommended by the medical and scientific community in an effort to stop the spread of the virus.Then  you had a vocal minority that consisted of a broad spectrum of people  that resisted efforts to stop the spread whether they didn't like wearing masks or didn't want to stay home or feared that there was a  conspiracy of one kind or another or just feared science altogether. They banded together in resistance to efforts to stop the spread to one degree or another.At this point  the vaccine has been administered to 2 billion people. Scientific research has overwhelmingly concluded that the vaccines are safe and effective as is evident from the decrease in hospitalizations and deaths. People who  resisted masking and isolation have dropped off this sub as a result of  the success of vaccinations in reducing the need for masks and isolating.  That only left the conspiracy theorists who thought  there were  nefarious reasons behind the push for vaccination, those that fear  science and vaccinations erroneously.As  we close in on a year of vaccinations and have passed 2 billion doses administered  with scientific research concluding undeniably that the vaccines are safe and effective only the most die hard anti vaxxers and conspiracy  theorists remain.So yes. This thread is dying and we're all better off for it."
